<h1 style="margin-top: 5em;">PREFACE</h1>


<p><span class="sc">Entrusted</span> by His Majesty the King with the duty of making
a selection from Queen Victoria's correspondence, we think it
well to describe briefly the nature of the documents which we
have been privileged to examine, as well as to indicate the
principles which have guided us throughout. It has been a
task of no ordinary difficulty. Her Majesty Queen Victoria
dealt with her papers, from the first, in a most methodical
manner; she formed the habit in early days of preserving her
private letters, and after her accession to the Throne all her
official papers were similarly treated, and bound in volumes.
The Prince Consort instituted an elaborate system of classification,
annotating and even indexing many of the documents with
his own hand. The result is that the collected papers form what
is probably the most extraordinary series of State documents
in the world. The papers which deal with the Queen's life up
to the year 1861 have been bound in chronological order, and
comprise between five and six hundred volumes. They consist,
in great part, of letters from Ministers detailing the proceedings
of Parliament, and of various political memoranda
dealing with home, foreign, and colonial policy; among these
are a few drafts of Her Majesty's replies. There are volumes
concerned with the affairs of almost every European country;
with the history of India, the British Army, the Civil List, the
Royal Estates, and all the complicated machinery of the
Monarchy and the Constitution. There are letters from
monarchs and royal personages, and there is further a whole
series of volumes dealing with matters in which the Prince
Consort took a special interest. Some of them are arranged
chronologically, some by subjects. Among the most interesting
volumes are those containing the letters written by Her
Majesty to her uncle Leopold, King of the Belgians, and his
replies.<sup>1</sup> The collection of letters from and to Lord Melbourne
forms another hardly less interesting series. In many places
Queen Victoria caused extracts, copied from her own private
Diaries, dealing with important political events or describing
momentous interviews, to be inserted in the volumes, with the
evident intention of illustrating and completing the record.</p>

<p class="footnote">Footnote 1: A set of volumes containing the Queen's letters to Lord John
Russell came into our hands too late to be made use of for the present publication.
</p>

<p>It became obvious at once that it was impossible to deal with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.iv" id="pagei.iv"></a>[page&nbsp;iv]</span>
these papers exhaustively. They would provide material
for a historical series extending to several hundred volumes.
Moreover, on the other hand, there are many gaps, as a great
deal of the business of State was transacted by interviews of
which no official record is preserved.</p>

<p>His Majesty the King having decided that no attempt
should be made to publish these papers <i>in extenso</i>, it was necessary
to determine upon some definite principle of selection.
It became clear that the only satisfactory plan was to publish
specimens of such documents as would serve to bring out the
development of the Queen's character and disposition, and to
give typical instances of her methods in dealing with political
and social matters&mdash;to produce, in fact, a book for British
citizens and British subjects, rather than a book for students of
political history. That the inner working of the unwritten
constitution of the country; that some of the unrealised checks
and balances; that the delicate equipoise of the component
parts of our executive machinery, should stand revealed, was
inevitable. We have thought it best, throughout, to abstain
from unnecessary comment and illustration. The period is
so recent, and has been so often traversed by historians and
biographers, that it appeared to us a waste of valuable space to
attempt to reconstruct the history of the years from which
this correspondence has been selected, especially as Sir Theodore
Martin, under the auspices of the Queen herself, has dealt
so minutely and exhaustively with the relations of the Queen's
innermost circle to the political and social life of the time. It
is tempting, of course, to add illustrative anecdotes from the
abundant Biographies and Memoirs of the period; but our
aim has been to infringe as little as possible upon the space
available for the documents themselves, and to provide just
sufficient comment to enable an ordinary reader, without
special knowledge of the period, to follow the course of events,
and to realise the circumstances under which the Queen's
childhood was passed, the position of affairs at the time of her
accession, and the personalities of those who had influenced
her in early years, or by whom she was surrounded.</p>

<p>The development of the Queen's character is clearly indicated
in the papers, and it possesses an extraordinary interest. We
see one of highly vigorous and active temperament, of strong
affections, and with a deep sense of responsibility, placed at an
early age, and after a quiet girlhood, in a position the greatness
of which it is impossible to exaggerate. We see her
character expand and deepen, schooled by mighty experience
into patience and sagacity and wisdom, and yet never losing
a particle of the strength, the decision, and the devotion with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.v" id="pagei.v"></a>[page&nbsp;v]</span>
which she had been originally endowed. Up to the year 1861
the Queen's career was one of unexampled prosperity. She
was happy in her temperament, in her health, in her education,
in her wedded life, in her children. She saw a great Empire
grow through troubled times in liberty and power and greatness;
yet this prosperity brought with it no shadow of complacency,
because the Queen felt with an increasing depth
the anxieties and responsibilities inseparable from her great
position. Her happiness, instead of making her self-absorbed,
only quickened her beneficence and her womanly desire that
her subjects should be enabled to enjoy a similar happiness
based upon the same simple virtues. Nothing comes out more
strongly in these documents than the laborious patience with
which the Queen kept herself informed of the minutest details
of political and social movements both in her own and other
countries.</p>

<p>It is a deeply inspiring spectacle to see one surrounded by
every temptation which worldly greatness can present, living
from day to day so simple, vivid, and laborious a life; and it
is impossible to conceive a more fruitful example of duty and
affection and energy, displayed on so august a scale, and in the
midst of such magnificent surroundings. We would venture
to believe that nothing could so deepen the personal devotion
of the Empire to the memory of that great Queen who ruled
it so wisely and so long, and its deeply-rooted attachment to the
principle of constitutional monarchy, as the gracious act of His
Majesty the King in allowing the inner side of that noble life
and career to be more clearly revealed to a nation whose
devotion to their ancient liberties is inseparably connected
with their loyalty to the Throne.</p>

<h2  style="margin-top: 5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">CHAPTER I</h2>

<h5>THE ANCESTRY OF THE QUEEN&mdash;HOUSES OF BRUNSWICK,<br />
HANOVER, AND COBURG</h5>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="sc">Queen Victoria</span>, on her father's side, belonged to the House
of Brunswick, which was undoubtedly one of the oldest, and
claimed to be actually the oldest, of German princely families.
At the time of her birth, it existed in two branches, of which,
the one ruled over what was called the Duchy of Brunswick,
the other over the Electorate (since 1815 the Kingdom) of
Hanover, and had since 1714 occupied the throne of
England. There had been frequent intermarriages between
the two branches. The Dukes of Brunswick were now,
however, represented only by two young princes, who were
the sons of the celebrated Duke who fell at Quatre-Bras.
Between them and the English Court there was little intercourse.
The elder, Charles, had quarrelled with his uncle
and guardian, George IV., and had in 1830 been expelled from
his dominions. The obvious faults of his character made it
impossible for the other German princes to insist on his being
restored, and he had been succeeded by his younger brother
William, who ruled till his death in 1884. Both died unmarried,
and with them the Ducal family came to an end.
One Princess of Brunswick had been the wife of George IV.,
and another, Augusta, was the first wife of Frederick I., King
of W&uuml;rtemberg, who, after her death, married a daughter of
George III. The King of W&uuml;rtemberg was also, by his descent
from Frederick Prince of Wales, first cousin once removed of
the Queen. We need only notice, in passing, the distant
connection with the royal families of Prussia, the Netherlands,
and Denmark. The Prince of Orange, who was one of the
possible suitors for the young Queen's hand, was her third
cousin once removed.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE HOUSE OF SAXE-COBURG-GOTHA</span>

<p>The House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, to which the Queen
belonged on her mother's side, and with which she was to be
even more intimately connected by her marriage, was one of
the numerous branches into which the ancient and celebrated
House of Wettin had broken up. Since the 11th century they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.2" id="pagei.2"></a>[page&nbsp;2]</span>
had ruled over Meissen and the adjoining districts. To these
had been added Upper Saxony and Thuringia. In the 15th
century the whole possessions of the House had been divided
between the two great branches which still exist. The Albertine
branch retained Meissen and the Saxon possessions.
They held the title of Elector, which in 1806 was exchanged
for the title of King. Though the Saxon House had been the
chief protectors of the Reformation, Frederick Augustus I. had,
on being elected to the throne of Poland, become a Roman
Catholic; and thereby the connection between the two
branches of the House had to a great extent ceased. The
second line, that of the Ernestines, ruled over Thuringia, but,
according to the common German custom, had again broken
up into numerous branches, among which the Duchies of
Thuringia were parcelled out. At the time of the Queen's
birth there were five of these, viz., Gotha-Altenburg, Coburg-Saalfeld,
Weimar-Eisenach, Meiningen, and Hildburghausen.
On the extinction of the Gotha line, in 1825, there was a rearrangement
of the family property, by which the Duke of
Hildburghausen received Altenburg, Gotha was given to the
Duke of Coburg, and Saalfeld with Hildburghausen added to
Meiningen. These four lines still exist.</p>

<p>The Ernestine princes had, by this constant division and
sub-division, deprived themselves of the opportunity of
exercising any predominant influence, or pursuing any independent
policy in German affairs; and though they had the
good fortune to emerge from the revolution with their possessions
unimpaired, their real power was not increased. Like
all the other princes, they had, however, at the Congress of
Vienna, received the recognition of their full status as sovereign
princes of the Germanic Confederation. Together they sent a
single representative to the Diet of Frankfort, the total population
of the five principalities being only about 300,000
inhabitants.</p>

<p>It was owing to this territorial sub-division and lack of
cohesion that these princes could not attach to their independence
the same political importance that fell to the share
of the larger principalities, such as Hanover and Bavaria, and
they were consequently more ready than the other German
princes to welcome proposals which would lead to a unification
of Germany.</p>

<p>It is notable that the line has produced many of the most
enlightened of the German princes; and nowhere in the whole
of Germany were the advantages of the division into numerous
small States so clearly seen, and the disadvantages so little felt,
as at Weimar, Meiningen, Gotha, and Coburg.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.3" id="pagei.3"></a>[page&nbsp;3]</span>

<span class="rightnote">THE HOUSE OF COBURG</span>

<p>The House of Coburg had gained a highly conspicuous and
influential position, owing, partly, to the high reputation for
sagacity and character which the princes of that House had
won, and partly to the marriage connections which were entered
into about this time by members of the Coburg House with the
leading Royal families of Europe. Within ten years, Princes
of Coburg were established, one upon the throne of Belgium,
and two others next to the throne in Portugal and England, as
Consorts of their respective Queens.</p>

<p>By the first marriage of the Duchess of Kent, the Queen
was also connected with a third class of German princes&mdash;the
Mediatised, as those were called who during the revolution
had lost their sovereign power. Many of these were of as
ancient lineage and had possessed as large estates as some of
the regnant princes, who, though not always more deserving,
had been fortunate enough to retain their privileges, and had
emerged from the revolution ranking among the ruling Houses
of Europe. The mediatised princes, though they had ceased
to rule, still held important privileges, which were guaranteed
at the Congress of Vienna. First, and most important, they
were reckoned as "<i>ebenburtig</i>," which means that they could
contract equal marriages with the Royal Houses, and these
marriages were recognised as valid for the transmission of
rights of inheritance. Many of them had vast private estates,
and though they were subjected to the sovereignty of the
princes in whose dominions these lay, they enjoyed very important
privileges, such as exemption from military service, and
from many forms of taxation; they also could exercise minor
forms of jurisdiction. They formed, therefore, an intermediate
class. Since Germany, as a whole, afforded them no
proper sphere of political activity, the more ambitious did not
disdain to take service with Austria or Prussia, and, to a less
extent, even with the smaller States. It was possible, therefore,
for the Queen's mother, a Princess of Saxe-Coburg, to
marry the Prince of Leiningen without losing caste. Her
daughter, the Princess Feodore, the Queen's half-sister, married
Ernest, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, and thus established
an interesting connection with perhaps the most widely-spread
and most distinguished of all these families. The House of
Hohenlohe would probably still have been a reigning family,
had not the Prince of Hohenlohe preferred to fight in the
Prussian army against Napoleon, rather than receive gifts from
him. His lands were consequently confiscated and passed to
other princes who were less scrupulous. The family has given
two Ministers President to Prussia, a General in chief command
of the Prussian army, a Chancellor to the German Empire, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.4" id="pagei.4"></a>[page&nbsp;4]</span>
one of the most distinguished of modern military writers.
They held, besides their extensive possessions in W&uuml;rtemberg
and Bavaria, the County of Gleichen in Saxe-Coburg.</p>

<span class="rightnote">FAMILY CONNECTIONS</span>

<p>It will be seen therefore that the Queen was intimately connected
with all classes that are to be found among the ruling
families of Germany, though naturally with the Catholic
families, which looked to Austria and Bavaria for guidance, she
had no close ties. But it must be borne in mind that her connection
with Germany always remained a personal and family
matter, and not a political one; this was the fortunate result
of the predominance of the Coburg influence. Had that of the
House of Hanover been supreme, it could hardly have been
possible for the Queen not to have been drawn into the opposition
to the unification of Germany by Prussia, in which the
House of Hanover was bound to take a leading part, in virtue
of its position, wealth, and dignity.</p>

<p>It will be as well here to mention the principal reigning
families of Europe to which Queen Victoria was closely allied
through her mother.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Kent's eldest brother, Ernest, Duke of Saxe-Coburg,
was the father of Albert, Prince Consort. Her sister
was the wife of Alexander, Duke of W&uuml;rtemberg. The Duchess
of Kent's nephew, Ferdinand (son of Ferdinand, the Duchess's
brother), married Maria da Gloria, Queen of Portugal, and was
father of Pedro V. and Luis, both subsequently Kings of
Portugal.</p>

<p>The Duchess's third brother, Leopold (afterwards King of
the Belgians), married first the Princess Charlotte, daughter of
George IV., and afterwards the Princess Louise Marie, eldest
daughter of King Louis Philippe. Prince Augustus (son of
Ferdinand, the Duchess of Kent's brother) married another
daughter of Louis Philippe, the Princess Cl&eacute;mentine, while
Prince Augustus's sister, Victoria, married the Duc de Nemours,
a son of Louis Philippe. Another nephew, Duke Friedrich
Wilhelm Alexander, son of the Duchess of W&uuml;rtemberg,
married the Princess Marie, another daughter of Louis Philippe.</p>

<p>Thus Queen Victoria was closely allied with the royal families
of France, Portugal, Belgium, Saxe-Coburg, and W&uuml;rtemberg.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE ENGLISH ROYAL FAMILY</span>

<p>On turning to the immediate Royal Family of England, it
will be seen that the male line at the time of the Queen's accession
was limited to the sons, both named George, of two of
the younger brothers of George IV., the Dukes of Cumberland
and Cambridge. The sons of George III. played their part in
the national life, shared the strong interest in military matters,
and showed the great personal courage which was a tradition
of the family.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.5" id="pagei.5"></a>[page&nbsp;5]</span>

<p>It must be borne in mind that abstention from active political
life had been in no sense required, or even thought desirable,
in members of the Royal House. George III. himself had
waged a lifelong struggle with the Whig party, that powerful
oligarchy that since the accession of the House of Hanover had
virtually ruled the country; but he did not carry on the conflict
so much by encouraging the opponents of the Whigs, as
by placing himself at the head of a monarchical faction. He
was in fact the leader of a third party in the State. George IV.
was at first a strong Whig, and lived on terms of the greatest
intimacy with Charles James Fox; but by the time that he
was thirty, he had severed the connection with his former
political friends, which had indeed originally arisen more out of
his personal opposition to his father than from any political
convictions. After this date he became, with intervals of
vacillation, an advanced Tory of an illiberal type. William IV.
had lived so much aloof from politics before his accession, that
he had had then no very pronounced opinions, though he was
believed to be in favour of the Reform Bill; during his reign
his Tory sympathies became more pronounced, and the position
of the Whig Ministry was almost an intolerable one. His other
<span class="rightnote">THE ROYAL DUKES</span>
brothers were men of decided views, and for the most part of
high social gifts. They not only attended debates in the House
of Peers, but spoke with emotion and vigour; they held
political interviews with leading statesmen, and considered
themselves entitled, not to over-rule political movements, but
to take the part in them to which their strong convictions
prompted them. They were particularly prominent in the
debates on the Catholic question, and did not hesitate to
express their views with an energy that was often embarrassing.
The Duke of York and the Duke of Cumberland had used all
their influence to encourage the King in his opposition to
Catholic Emancipation, while the Duke of Cambridge had supported
that policy, and the Duke of Sussex had spoken in the
House of Lords in favour of it. The Duke of York, a kindly,
generous man, had held important commands in the earlier part
of the Revolutionary war; he had not shown tactical nor
strategical ability, but he was for many years Commander-in-Chief
of the Army, and did good administrative work in
initiating and carrying out much-needed military reforms.
He had married a Prussian princess, but left no issue, and his
death, in 1827, left the succession open to his younger brother,
the Duke of Clarence, afterwards King William IV., and after
him to the Princess Victoria.</p>

<p>The Duke of Kent was, as we shall have occasion to show, a
strong Whig with philanthropic views. But the ablest of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.6" id="pagei.6"></a>[page&nbsp;6]</span>
princes, though also the most unpopular, was the Duke of
Cumberland, who, until the birth of the Queen's first child, was
heir presumptive to the Throne. He had been one of the most
active members of the ultra-Tory party, who had opposed to
the last the Emancipation of the Catholics and the Reform
Bill. He had married a sister-in-law of the King of Prussia,
and lived much in Berlin, where he was intimate with the
leaders of the military party, who were the centre of reactionary
influences in that country, chief among them being his brother-in-law,
Prince Charles of Mecklenburg.</p>

<p>In private life the Duke was bluff and soldier-like, of rather
a bullying turn, and extraordinarily indifferent to the feelings
of others. "Ernest is not a bad fellow," his brother William IV.
said of him, "but if anyone has a corn, he will be sure to tread
on it." He was very unpopular in England.</p>

<p>On the death of William IV. he succeeded to the throne of
Hanover, and from that time seldom visited England. His
first act on reaching his kingdom was to declare invalid the
Constitution which had been granted in 1833 by William IV.
His justification for this was that his consent, as heir presumptive,
which was necessary for its validity, had not at the
time been asked. The act caused great odium to be attached
to his name by all Liberals, both English and Continental, and
it was disapproved of even by his old Tory associates. None
the less he soon won great popularity in his own dominions by
his zeal, good-humour, and energy, and in 1840 he came to
terms with the Estates. A new Constitution was drawn up
which preserved more of the Royal prerogatives than the
instrument of 1833. Few German princes suffered so little in
the revolution of 1848. The King died in 1851, at the age of
eighty, and left one son, George, who had been blind from his
boyhood. He was the last King of Hanover, being expelled
by the Prussians in 1866. On the failure of the Ducal line of
Brunswick, the grandson of Ernest Augustus became heir to
their dominions, he and his sons being now the sole male representatives
of all the branches of the House of Brunswick, which
a few generations ago was one of the most numerous and
widely-spread ruling Houses in Germany.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p class="footnote">Footnote 1: Of the daughters of George III., Princess Amelia had died in 1810, and the Queen
of W&uuml;rtemberg in 1828; two married daughters survived&mdash;Elizabeth, wife of the Landgrave
of Hesse-Homburg, and Mary, who had married her cousin, the Duke of Gloucester,
and lived in England. There were also two unmarried daughters, the Princesses Augusta
and Sophia, living in England.
</p>

<p>The Duke of Sussex was in sympathy with many Liberal
movements, and supported the removal of religious disabilities,
the abolition of the Corn Laws, and Parliamentary Reform.</p>

<p>The Duke of Cambridge was a moderate Tory, and the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.7" id="pagei.7"></a>[page&nbsp;7]</span>
conciliatory of all the princes. But for more than twenty years
he took little part in English politics, as he was occupied with
his duties as Regent of Hanover, where he did much by prudent
reforms to retain the allegiance of the Hanoverians. On his
return to England he resumed the position of a peacemaker,
supporting philanthropic movements, and being a generous
patron of art and letters. He was recognised as "emphatically
the connecting link between the Crown and the people."
Another member of the Royal Family was the Duke of Gloucester,
nephew and son-in-law of George III.; he was more
interested in philanthropic movements than in politics, but
was a moderate Conservative, who favoured Catholic Emancipation
but was opposed to Parliamentary Reform.</p>

<p>Thus we have the spectacle of seven Royal princes, of whom
two succeeded to the Throne, all or nearly all avowed politicians
of decided convictions, throwing the weight of their
influence and social position for the most part on the side of
the Tory party, and believing it to be rather their duty to hold
and express strong political opinions than to adopt the
moderating and conciliatory attitude in matters of government
that is now understood to be the true function of the
Royal House.</p>

<span class="rightnote">INDEPENDENCE OF THE QUEEN</span>

<p>The Queen, after her accession, always showed great respect
and affection for her uncles, but they were not able to exercise
any influence over her character or opinions.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 5em;">This was partly due to the fact that from an early age she
had imbibed a respect for liberal views from her uncle Leopold,
King of the Belgians, to whom she was devoted from her
earliest childhood, and for whom she entertained feelings of
the deepest admiration, affection, and confidence; but still
more was it due to the fact that, from the very first, the Queen
instinctively formed an independent judgment on any question
that concerned her; and though she was undoubtedly influenced
in her decisions by her affectionate reliance on her
chosen advisers, yet those advisers were always deliberately
and shrewdly selected, and their opinions were in no case
allowed to do more than modify her own penetrating and
clear-sighted judgment.</p>

<h2  style="margin-top: 5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">CHAPTER II</h2>

<h5>MEMOIR OF QUEEN VICTORIA'S EARLY YEARS</h5>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="sc">Alexandrina Victoria</span>, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland
and Empress of India, was born on Monday, 24th May 1819,
at Kensington Palace.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF KENT</span>

<p>Her father, Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (1767-1820),
the fourth son of George III., was a man of decided
character, kindly, pious, punctual, with a strict sense of duty
and enlightened ideas. He was a devoted soldier, and, as
Queen Victoria once said, "was proud of his profession, and
I was always taught to consider myself a soldier's child." He
had a wide military experience, having served at Gibraltar, in
Canada, and in the West Indies. He had been mentioned
in despatches, but was said to be over-strict in matters of
unimportant detail. His active career was brought to an end
in 1802, when he had been sent to Gibraltar to restore order
in a mutinous garrison. Order had been restored, but the
Duke was recalled under allegations of having exercised undue
severity, and the investigation which he demanded was refused
him, though he was afterwards made a Field-Marshal.</p>

<p>He was a man of advanced Liberal ideas. He had spoken
in the House of Lords in favour of Catholic Emancipation,
and had shown himself interested in the abolition of slavery
and in popular education. His tastes were literary, and
towards the end of his life he had even manifested a strong
sympathy for socialistic theories.</p>

<p>At the time of the death of the Princess Charlotte, 6th
November 1817, the married sons of King George III. were
without legitimate children, and the surviving daughters were
either unmarried or childless. Alliances were accordingly
arranged for the three unmarried Royal Dukes, and in the
course of the year 1818 the Dukes of Cambridge, Kent, and
Clarence led their brides to the altar.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Kent (1786-1861), Victoria Mary Louisa,
was a daughter of Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.9" id="pagei.9"></a>[page&nbsp;9]</span>
was the widow of Emich Charles, Prince of Leiningen,<sup>1</sup> whom
she had married in 1803, and who had died in 1814, leaving a
son and a daughter by her.</p>

<p class="footnote">Footnote 1: <i>Leiningen</i>, a mediatised princely House of Germany, dating back to 1096. In 1779
the head of one of the branches into which it had become divided, the Count of Leiningen-Dachsburg-Hardenburg,
was raised to the rank of a prince of the Empire, but the Peace
of Lun&eacute;ville (1801) deprived him of his ancient possessions, extending about 232 miles on
the left bank of the Rhine. Though no longer an independent Prince, the head of the
House retains his rank and wealth, and owns extensive estates in Bavaria and Hesse.
</p>

<p>The Duke of Kent died prematurely&mdash;though he had always
been a conspicuously healthy man&mdash;at Sidmouth, on the
23rd of January 1820, only a week before his father.</p>

<p>A paper preserved in the Windsor archives gives a touching
account of the Duke's last hours. The Regent, on the 22nd of
January, sent to him a message of solicitude and affection,
expressing an anxious wish for his recovery. The Duke roused
himself to enquire how the Prince was in health, and said, "If
I could now shake hands with him, I should die in peace." A
few hours before the end, one who stood by the curtain of his
bed heard the Duke say with deep emotion, "May the Almighty
protect my wife and child, and forgive all the sins I
have committed." His last words&mdash;addressed to his wife&mdash;were,
"Do not forget me."</p>

<p>The Duchess of Kent was an affectionate, impulsive woman,
with more emotional sympathy than practical wisdom in worldly
matters. But her claim on the gratitude of the British nation
is that she brought up her illustrious daughter in habits of
simplicity, self-sacrifice, and obedience.</p>

<p>As a testimony to the sincere appreciation entertained by
the politicians of the time for the way in which the Duchess of
Kent had appreciated her responsibilities with regard to the
education of a probable heir to the Crown of England, we may
quote a few sentences from two speeches made in the House
of Commons, in the debate which took place (27th May 1825)
on the question of increasing the Parliamentary annuity paid
to the Duchess, in order to provide duly for the education of
the young Princess.</p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Robinson, afterwards
Lord Ripon, said:</p>

<p>
"The position in which this Princess stood with respect to
the throne of the country could not fail to make her an object
of general interest to the nation. He had not himself the
honour of being acquainted with the Duchess of Kent, but he
believed that she had taken the greatest pains with her
daughter's education. She had been brought up in principles
of piety and morality, and to feel a <i>proper</i> sense, he meant by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.10" id="pagei.10"></a>[page&nbsp;10]</span>
that an humble sense, of her own dignity, and the rank which
probably awaited her. Perhaps it might have been fit to have
brought this matter before Parliament at an earlier period."
</p>

<p>Mr Canning said:</p>

<p>
"All parties agreed in the propriety of the Grant, and if
Government had anything to answer for on this point, it was
for having so long delayed bringing it before the House.
There could not be a greater compliment to Her Royal Highness
than to state the quiet unobtrusive tenor of her life, and
that she had never made herself the object of public gaze, but
had devoted herself to the education of her child, whom the
House was now called upon to adopt."
</p>

<span class="rightnote">EARLY REMINISCENCES</span>

<p>In the year 1872 Queen Victoria wrote down with her own
hand some reminiscences of her early childhood, the manuscript
of which is preserved at Windsor, and which may be
quoted here.</p>

<p>"My earliest recollections are connected with Kensington
Palace, where I can remember crawling on a yellow carpet
spread out for that purpose&mdash;and being told that if I cried and
was naughty my 'Uncle Sussex' would hear me and punish
me, for which reason I always screamed when I saw him! I
had a great horror of <i>Bishops</i> on account of their wigs and
<i>aprons</i>, but recollect this being partially got over in the case
of the then Bishop of Salisbury (Dr Fisher, great-uncle to Mr
Fisher, Private Secretary to the Prince of Wales), by his
kneeling down and letting me play with his badge of Chancellor
of the Order of the Garter. With another Bishop, however,
the persuasion of showing him my 'pretty shoes' was of no
use. Claremont remains as the brightest epoch of my otherwise
rather melancholy childhood&mdash;where to be under the roof
of that beloved Uncle&mdash;to listen to some music in the Hall when
there were dinner-parties&mdash;and to go and see dear old Louis!&mdash;the
former faithful and devoted Dresser and friend of Princess
Charlotte&mdash;beloved and respected by all who knew her&mdash;and
who doted on the little Princess who was too much an idol in
the House. This dear old lady was visited by every one&mdash;and
was the only really devoted Attendant of the poor Princess,
whose governesses paid little real attention to her&mdash;and who
never left her, and was with her when she died. I used to ride
a donkey given me by my Uncle, the Duke of York, who was
very kind to me. I remember him well&mdash;tall, rather large,
very kind but extremely shy. He always gave me beautiful
presents. The last time I saw him was at Mr Greenwood's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.11" id="pagei.11"></a>[page&nbsp;11]</span>
house, where D. Carlos lived at one time,&mdash;when he was
already very ill,&mdash;and he had Punch and Judy in the garden
for me.</p>

<p>"To Ramsgate we used to go frequently in the summer, and
I remember living at Townley House (near the town), and
going there by steamer. Mamma was very unwell. Dear
Uncle Leopold went with us.</p>

<p>"To Tunbridge Wells we also went, living at a house called
Mt. Pleasant, now an Hotel. Many pleasant days were spent
here, and the return to Kensington in October or November
was generally a day of tears.</p>

<p>"I was brought up very simply&mdash;never had a room to myself
till I was nearly grown up&mdash;always slept in my Mother's
room till I came to the Throne. At Claremont, and in the
small houses at the bathing-places, I sat and took my lessons
in my Governess's bedroom. I was not fond of learning as a
little child&mdash;and baffled every attempt to teach me my letters
up to 5 years old&mdash;when I consented to learn them by their
being written down before me.</p>

<span class="rightnote">GEORGE IV.</span>

<p>"I remember going to Carlton House, when George IV.
lived there, as quite a little child before a dinner the King gave.
The Duchess of Cambridge and my 2 cousins, George and
Augusta, were there. My Aunt, the Queen of W&uuml;rtemberg
(Princess Royal), came over, in the year '26, I think, and I
recollect perfectly well seeing her drive through the Park in
the King's carriage with red liveries and 4 horses, in a <i>Cap</i> and
evening dress,&mdash;my Aunt, her sister Princess Augusta, sitting
<i>opposite</i> to her, also in evening attire, having dined early with
the Duke of Sussex at Kensington. She had adopted all the
German fashions and spoke broken English&mdash;and had not been
in England for many many years. She was very kind and
good-humoured but very large and unwieldy. She lived at St
James's and had a number of Germans with her. In the year
'26 (I think) George IV. asked my Mother, my Sister and me
down to Windsor for the first time; he had been on bad terms
with my poor father when he died,&mdash;and took hardly any
notice of the poor widow and little fatherless girl, who were so
poor at the time of his (the Duke of Kent's) death, that they
could not have travelled back to Kensington Palace had it not
been for the kind assistance of my dear Uncle, Prince Leopold.
We went to Cumberland Lodge, the King living at the Royal
Lodge. Aunt Gloucester was there at the same time. When
we arrived at the Royal Lodge the King took me by the hand,
saying: 'Give me your little paw.' He was large and gouty
but with a wonderful dignity and charm of manner. He wore
the wig which was so much worn in those days. Then he said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.12" id="pagei.12"></a>[page&nbsp;12]</span>
he would give me something for me to wear, and that was his
picture set in diamonds, which was worn by the Princesses as
an order to a blue ribbon on the left shoulder. I was very
proud of this,&mdash;and Lady Conyngham pinned it on my
shoulder. Her husband, the late Marquis of Conyngham,
was the Lord Chamberlain and constantly there, as well as
Lord Mt. Charles (as Vice-Chamberlain), the <i>present</i> Lord
Conyngham.</p>

<p>"None of the Royal Family or general visitors lived at the
Royal Lodge, but only the Conyngham family; all the rest at
Cumberland Lodge. Lady Maria Conyngham (now dead, first
wife to Lord Athlumney, daughter of Lord Conyngham), then
quite young, and Lord Graves (brother-in-law to Lord Anglesey
and who afterwards shot himself on account of his wife's conduct,
who was a Lady of the Bedchamber), were desired to
take me a drive to amuse me. I went with them, and Baroness
(then Miss) Lehzen (my governess) in a pony carriage and 4,
with 4 grey ponies (like my own), and was driven about the
Park and taken to Sandpit Gate where the King had a Menagerie&mdash;with
wapitis, gazelles, chamois, etc., etc. Then we
went (I think the next day) to Virginia Water, and met the
King in his phaeton in which he was driving the Duchess of
Gloucester,&mdash;and he said 'Pop her in,' and I was lifted in and
placed between him and Aunt Gloucester, who held me round
the waist. (Mamma was much frightened.) I was greatly
pleased, and remember that I looked with great respect at the
scarlet liveries, etc. (the Royal Family had crimson and green
liveries and only the King scarlet and blue in those days). We
drove round the nicest part of Virginia Water and stopped at
the Fishing Temple. Here there was a large barge and every
one went on board and fished, while a band played in another!
There were numbers of great people there, amongst whom was
the last Duke of Dorset, then Master of the Horse. The King
paid great attention to my Sister,<sup>2</sup> and some people fancied he
might marry her!! She was very lovely then&mdash;about 18&mdash;and
had charming manners, about which the King was extremely
particular. I afterwards went with Baroness Lehzen
and Lady Maria C. to the Page Whiting's cottage. Whiting
had been at one time in my father's service. He lived where
Mr Walsh now does (and where he died years ago), in the small
cottage close by; and here I had some <i>fruit</i> and amused myself
by cramming one of Whiting's children, a little girl, with
peaches. I came after dinner to hear the band play in the
Conservatory, which is still standing, and which was lit up by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.13" id="pagei.13"></a>[page&nbsp;13]</span>
coloured lamps&mdash;the King, Royal Family, etc., sitting in a
corner of the large saloon, which still stands.</p>

<p class="footnote">Footnote 2: The Princess Feodore of Leiningen, afterwards Princess of Hohenlohe, Queen Victoria's
half-sister.
</p>

<p>"On the second visit (I <i>think</i>) the following year, also in
summer, there was a great encampment of tents (the same
which were used at the Camp at Chobham in '53, and some
single ones at the Breakfasts at Buckingham Palace in '68-9),
and which were quite like a house, made into different compartments.
It rained dreadfully on this occasion, I well remember.
The King and party dined there, Prince and Princess
Lieven, the Russian Ambassador and Ambassadress were there.</p>

<p>"I also remember going to see Aunt Augusta at Frogmore,
where she lived always in the summer.</p>

<p>"We lived in a very simple, plain manner; breakfast was at
half-past eight, luncheon at half-past one, dinner at seven&mdash;to
which I came generally (when it was no regular large dinner
party)&mdash;eating my bread and milk out of a small silver basin.
Tea was only allowed as a great treat in later years.</p>

<span class="rightnote">DUCHESS OF SAXE-COBURG-SAALFELD</span>

<p>"In 1826 (I think) my dear Grandmother, the Dowager
Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, came to Claremont, in the
summer. Mamma and my sister went on part of the way to
meet her, and Uncle Leopold I think had been to fetch her as
far as Dover. I recollect the excitement and anxiety I was in,
at this event,&mdash;going down the great flight of steps to meet her
when she got out of the carriage, and hearing her say, when she
sat down in her room, and fixed her fine clear blue eyes on her
little grand-daughter whom she called in her letters 'the flower
of May,' 'Ein sch&ouml;nes Kind'&mdash;'a fine child.' She was very
clever and adored by her children but especially by her sons.
She was a good deal bent and walked with a stick, and frequently
with her hands on her back. She took long drives in
an open carriage and I was frequently sent out with her, which
I am sorry to confess I did not like, as, like most children of
that age, I preferred running about. She was excessively kind
to children, but could not bear naughty ones&mdash;and I shall
never forget her coming into the room when I had been crying
and naughty at my lessons&mdash;from the next room but one,
where she had been with Mamma&mdash;and scolding me severely,
which had a very salutary effect. She dined early in the afternoon
and Uncle Leopold asked many of the neighbours and
others to dinner to meet her. My brother Prince Leiningen
came over with her, and was at that time paying his court to
one of her ladies, Countess Klebelsberg, whom he afterwards
married&mdash;against the wish of his grandmother and mother&mdash;but
which was afterwards quite made up. In November (I
think, or it may have been at the end of October) she left,
taking my sister with her back to Coburg. I was very ill at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.14" id="pagei.14"></a>[page&nbsp;14]</span>
that time, of dysentery, which illness increased to an alarming
degree; many children died of it in the village of Esher. The
Doctor lost his head, having lost his own child from it, and
almost every doctor in London was away. Mr Blagden came
down and showed much energy on the occasion. I recovered,
and remember well being very cross and screaming dreadfully
at having to wear, for a time, flannel next my skin. Up to my
5th year I had been very much indulged by every one, and set
pretty well <i>all</i> at defiance. Old Baroness de Sp&auml;th, the devoted
Lady of my Mother, my Nurse Mrs Brock, dear old Mrs
Louis&mdash;<i>all</i> worshipped the poor little fatherless child whose
future then was still very uncertain; my Uncle the Duke of
Clarence's poor little child being alive, and the Duchess of
Clarence had one or two others later. At 5 years old, Miss
Lehzen was placed about me, and though she was most kind,
she was very firm and I had a proper respect for her. I was
naturally very passionate, but always most contrite afterwards.
I was taught from the first to beg my maid's pardon for any
naughtiness or rudeness towards her; a feeling I have ever
retained, and think every one should <i>own</i> their fault in a kind
way to any one, be he or she the lowest&mdash;if one has been rude
to or injured them by word or deed, especially those below you.
People will readily forget an insult or an injury when others <i>own</i>
their fault, and express sorrow or regret at what they have done."</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE EDUCATION OF THE PRINCESS</span>

<p>In 1830 the Duchess of Kent wished to be satisfied that the
system of education then being pursued with the Princess was
based on the right lines, and that due moral and intellectual
progress was being made. A memorandum, carefully preserved
among the archives, gives an interesting account of the
steps which she took to this end.</p>

<span class="rightnote">LETTER TO THE BISHOPS</span>

<p>The Duchess therefore brought the matter under the consideration
of those whom, from their eminent piety, great
learning, and high station, she considered best calculated to
afford her valuable advice upon so important a subject. She
stated to the Bishops of London and Lincoln<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> the particular
course which had been followed in the Princess's education, and
requested their Lordships to test the result by personal examination.
The nature and objects of Her Royal Highness's
appeal to these eminent prelates will be best shown by the
following extracts from her letter to the Bishops:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"'The Princess will be eleven years of age in May; by the
death of her revered father when she was but eight months old,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.15" id="pagei.15"></a>[page&nbsp;15]</span>
her sole care and charge devolved to me. Stranger as I then
was, I became deeply impressed with the absolute necessity of
bringing her up entirely in this country, that every feeling
should be that of Her native land, and proving thereby my
devotion to duty by rejecting all those feelings of home and
kindred that divided my heart.</p>

<p>"'When the Princess approached her fifth year I considered
it the proper time to begin in a moderate way her education&mdash;an
education that was to fit Her to be either the Sovereign of
these realms, or to fill a junior station in the Royal Family,
until the Will of Providence should shew at a later period what
Her destiny was to be.</p>

<p>"'A revision of the papers I send you herewith will best
shew your Lordships the system pursued, the progress made,
etc. I attend almost always myself every lesson, or a part;
and as the Lady about the Princess is a competent person, she
assists Her in preparing Her lessons for the various masters, as
I resolved to act in that manner so as to be Her Governess myself.
I naturally hope that I have pursued that course most
beneficial to all the great interests at stake. At the present
moment no concern can be more momentous, or in which the
consequences, the interests of the Country, can be more at
stake, than the education of its future Sovereign.</p>

<p>"'I feel the time to be now come that what has been done
should be put to some test, that if anything has been done in
error of judgment it may be corrected, and that the plan for the
future should be open to consideration and revision. I do not
presume to have an over-confidence in what I have done; on
the contrary, as a female, as a stranger (but only in birth, as I
feel that this is my country by the duties I fulfil, and the support
I receive), I naturally desire to have a candid opinion from
authorities competent to give one. In that view I address
your Lordships; I would propose to you that you advert to all
I have stated, to the papers I lay before you, and that then
you should personally examine the Princess with a view of
telling me&mdash;
</p>


 <ul class="none">
  <li>"'1. If the course hitherto pursued in Her education has
      been the best; if not, where it was erroneous.</li>

<li>"'2. If the Princess has made all the Progress she should

<p>
"'Mr Davys<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> will explain to you the nature of the Princess's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.16" id="pagei.16"></a>[page&nbsp;16]</span>
religious education, which I have confided to him, that she
should be brought up in the Church of England as by Law
established. When she was at a proper age she commenced
attending Divine Service regularly with me, and I have every
feeling, that she has religion at Her heart, that she is morally
impressed with it to that degree, that she is less liable to error
by its application to Her feelings as a Child capable of reflection.
The general bent of Her character is strength of intellect,
capable of receiving with ease, information, and with a peculiar
readiness in coming to a very just and benignant decision on
any point Her opinion is asked on. Her adherence to truth is
of so marked a character that I feel no apprehension of that
Bulwark being broken down by any circumstance.</p>

<p>"'I must conclude by observing that as yet the Princess is
not aware of the station that she is likely to fill. She is aware
of its duties, and that a Sovereign should live for others; so
that when Her innocent mind receives the impression of Her
future fate, she receives it with a mind formed to be sensible of
what is to be expected from Her, and it is to be hoped, she will
be too well grounded in Her principles to be dazzled with the
station she is to look to.'"

<p>The examination was undertaken by the Bishops, with
highly satisfactory results. Their report says:</p>

<p>
"The result of the examination has been such as in our
opinion amply to justify the plan of instruction which has been
adopted. In answering a great variety of questions proposed
to her, the Princess displayed an accurate knowledge of the
most important features of Scripture History, and of the leading
truths and precepts of the Christian Religion as taught by
the Church of England, as well as an acquaintance with the
Chronology and principal facts of English History remarkable
in so young a person. To questions in Geography, the use of
the Globes, Arithmetic, and Latin Grammar, the answers
which the Princess returned were equally satisfactory.</p>

<p>"Upon the whole, we feel no hesitation in stating our opinion
that the Princess should continue, for some time to come, to
pursue her studies upon the same plan which has been hitherto
followed, and under the same superintendence. Nor do we
apprehend that any other alterations in the plan will be required
than those which will be gradually made by the judicious
director of Her Highness's studies, as the mind expands, and
her faculties are strengthened."
</p>

<span class="rightnote">RESULT OF EXAMINATION</span>

<p>The Duchess of Kent referred all this correspondence to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.17" id="pagei.17"></a>[page&nbsp;17]</span>
Archbishop of Canterbury.<sup>5</sup> His memorandum is preserved;
it states he has considered the Report, and further, has himself
personally examined the Princess. He continues:</p>

<p>
"I feel it my duty to say that in my judgment the plan of
Her Highness's studies, as detailed in the papers transmitted
to me by command of your Royal Highness, is very judicious,
and particularly suitable to Her Highness's exalted station;
and that from the proficiency exhibited by the Princess in the
examination at which I was present, and the general correctness
and pertinency of her answers, I am perfectly satisfied that
Her Highness's education in regard to cultivation of intellect,
improvement of talent, and religious and moral principle, is
conducted with so much care and success as to render any
alteration of the system undesirable."
</p>

<p class="footnote">Footnote 5: Dr William Howley.</p>

<p>The Princess was gradually and watchfully introduced to
public life, and was never allowed to lose sight of the fact that
her exalted position carried with it definite and obvious duties.
The following speech, delivered at Plymouth in 1832, in answer
to a complimentary deputation, may stand as an instance of
the view which the Duchess of Kent took of her own and her
daughter's responsibilities:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"It is very agreeable to the Princess and myself to hear the
sentiments you convey to us. It is also gratifying to us to be
assured that we owe all these kind feelings to the attachment
you bear the King, as well as to his Predecessors of the House
of Brunswick, from recollections of their paternal sway. The
object of my life is to render the Princess worthy of the affectionate
solicitude she inspires, and if it be the Will of Providence
she should fill a higher station (I trust most fervently at a very
distant day), I shall be fully repaid for my anxious care, if she
is found competent to discharge the sacred trust; for communicating
as the Princess does with all classes of Society, she
cannot but perceive that the greater the diffusion of Religion,
Knowledge, and the love of freedom in a country, the more
orderly, industrious, and wealthy is its population, and that
with the desire to preserve the constitutional Prerogatives of
the Crown ought to be co-ordinate the protection of the liberties
of the people."
</p>

<span class="rightnote">CLAREMONT</span>

<p>The strictness of the <i>r&eacute;gime</i> under which the Princess was
brought up is remarkable; and it is possible that her later zest
for simple social pleasures is partly to be accounted for by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.18" id="pagei.18"></a>[page&nbsp;18]</span>
austere routine of her early days. In an interesting letter of
1843 to the Queen, recalling the days of their childhood,
Princess Feodore, the Queen's half-sister, wrote&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Many, many thanks, dearest Victoria, for your kind letter
of the 7th from dear Claremont. Oh I understand how you
like being there. Claremont is a dear quiet place; to me also
the recollection of the few pleasant days I spent during my
youth. I always left Claremont with tears for Kensington
Palace. When I look back upon those years, which ought to
have been the happiest in my life, from fourteen to twenty, I
cannot help pitying myself. Not to have enjoyed the pleasures
of youth is nothing, but to have been deprived of all intercourse,
and not one cheerful thought in that dismal existence
of ours, was very hard. My only happy time was going or
driving out with you and Lehzen; then I could speak and look
as I liked. I escaped some years of imprisonment, which you,
my poor darling sister, had to endure after I was married.
But God Almighty has changed both our destinies most mercifully,
and has made us <i>so</i> happy in our homes&mdash;which is the
only real happiness in this life; and those years of trial were,
I am sure, very useful to us both, though certainly not pleasant.
Thank God they are over!... I was much amused in your
last letter at your tracing the <i>quickness</i> of our tempers in the
female line up to Grandmamma,<sup>6</sup> but I must own that you are
<i>quite right</i>!"
</p>

<p class="footnote">Footnote 6: Augusta Caroline Sophia, Dowager-Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, a Princess of
Reuss Ebersdorf (1757-1831).
</p>

<p>But if there was little amusement, there was, on the other
hand, great devotion; the Princess, as a child, had that peculiar
combination of self-will and warm-heartedness which is apt to
win for a child a special love from its elders. The Princess
Feodore wrote to the Queen, in 1843&mdash;</p>

<p>
"... Sp&auml;th<sup>7</sup> wished <i>me</i> to thank you for the coronation
print, as she could not write to you or Albert <i>now</i>, she says!
why, I don't see. There certainly never was such devotedness
as hers, to all our family, although it sometimes shows itself
rather foolishly&mdash;with you it always was a sort of idolatry,
when she used to go upon her knees before you, when you were
a child. She and poor old Louis did all they could to spoil you,
if Lehzen had not prevented and scolded them nicely sometimes;
it was quite amusing."
</p>

<p class="footnote">Footnote 7: Baroness Sp&auml;th, Lady-in-Waiting to the Duchess of Kent.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.19" id="pagei.19"></a>[page&nbsp;19]</span>

<p>The Princess was brought up with exemplary simplicity at
Kensington Palace, where her mother had a set of apartments.
She was often at Claremont, which belonged to her uncle
Leopold, King of the Belgians; holidays were spent at Ramsgate,
Tunbridge Wells, Broadstairs, and elsewhere.</p>

<span class="rightnote">WILLIAM IV.</span>

<p>In June 1830 George IV. died, and William IV. succeeded to
the Throne. He had no legitimate offspring living; and it
consequently became practically certain that if the Princess
outlived her uncle she would succeed him on the Throne. The
Duchess of Kent's Parliamentary Grant was increased, and she
took advantage of her improved resources to familiarise the
Princess with the social life of the nation. They paid visits to
historic houses and important towns, and received addresses.
This was a wise and prudent course, but the King spoke with
ill-humour of his niece's "royal progresses." The chief cause
of offence was that the Princess was not allowed by the
Duchess of Kent to make her public appearances under his
own auspices, as he not unnaturally desired. He also began
to suspect that the Princess was deliberately kept away from
Court; a painful controversy arose, and the Duchess became
gradually estranged from her brother-in-law, in spite of the
affectionate attempts of Queen Adelaide to smooth matters
over. His resentment culminated in a painful scene, in 1836,
when the King, at a State banquet at Windsor, made a speech
of a preposterous character; speaking of the Duchess, who
sat next him, as "that person," hinting that she was surrounded
with evil advisers, and adding that he should insist on
the Princess being more at Court. The Princess burst into
tears; the Duchess sate in silence: when the banquet was
over, the Duchess ordered her carriage, and was with difficulty
prevailed upon to remain at Windsor for the night. The King
went so far in May 1837 as to offer the Princess an independent
income, and the acceptance of this by the Princess caused the
Duchess considerable vexation; but the project dropped.
The King died in the following month, soon after the Princess
had attained her legal majority; he had always hoped that the
Duchess would not be Regent, and his wish was thus fulfilled.</p>

<p>It is no exaggeration to say that the accession of the Princess
Victoria reinstated the English monarchy in the affections of
the people. George IV. had made the Throne unpopular;
William IV. had restored its popularity, but not its dignity.
Both of these kings were men of decided ability, but of unbalanced
temperament. In politics both kings had followed a
somewhat similar course. George IV. had begun life as a
strong Whig, and had been a close friend of Fox. Later in life
his political position resolved itself into a strong dislike of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.20" id="pagei.20"></a>[page&nbsp;20]</span>
Roman Catholic Relief. William IV. had begun his reign
favourably inclined to Parliamentary Reform; but though
gratified by the personal popularity which his attitude brought
him in the country, he became alarmed at the national temper
displayed. It illustrates the tension of the King's mind on the
subject that, when he was told that if the Reform Bill did not
pass it would bring about a rebellion, he replied that if it did
bring about a rebellion he did not care: he should defend
London and raise the Royal Standard at Weedon (where there
was a military dep&ocirc;t); and that the Duchess of Kent and the
Princess Victoria might come in if they could.</p>

<p>The reign of William IV. had witnessed the zenith of Whig
efficiency. It had seen the establishment of Parliamentary and
Municipal Reform, the Abolition of Slavery, the new Poor Law,
and other important measures. But, towards the end of the
reign, the Whig party began steadily to lose ground, and the
Tories to consolidate themselves. Lord Melbourne had succeeded
Lord Grey at the head of the Whigs, and the difference
of administration was becoming every month more and more
apparent. The King indeed went so far as abruptly to dismiss
his Ministers, but Parliament was too strong for him. Lord
Melbourne's principles were fully as liberal as Lord Grey's, but
he lacked practical initiative, with the result that the Whigs
gradually forfeited popular estimation and became discredited.
The new reign, however, brought them a decided increase of
strength. The Princess had been brought up with strong Whig
leanings, and, as is clear from her letters, with an equally
strong mistrust of Tory principles and politicians.</p>

<span class="rightnote">CHARACTER AND TEMPERAMENT</span>

<p style="margin-bottom: 5em;">A word may here be given to the Princess's own character
and temperament. She was high-spirited and wilful, but devotedly
affectionate, and almost typically feminine. She had
a strong sense of duty and dignity, and strong personal prejudices.
Confident, in a sense, as she was, she had the feminine
instinct strongly developed of dependence upon some manly
adviser. She was full of high spirits, and enjoyed excitement
and life to the full. She liked the stir of London, was fond of
dancing, of concerts, plays, and operas, and devoted to open-air
exercise. Another important trait in her character must be
noted. She had strong monarchical views and dynastic sympathies,
but she had no aristocratic preferences; at the same
time she had no democratic principles, but believed firmly in
the due subordination of classes. The result of the parliamentary
and municipal reforms of William IV.'s reign had been
to give the middle classes a share in the government of the
country, and it was supremely fortunate that the Queen, by a
providential gift of temperament, thoroughly understood the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.21" id="pagei.21"></a>[page&nbsp;21]</span>
middle-class point of view. The two qualities that are most<span class="rightnote">SYMPATHY WITH MIDDLE CLASSES</span>
characteristic of British middle-class life are common sense and
family affection; and on these particular virtues the Queen's
character was based; so that by a happy intuition she was
able to interpret and express the spirit and temper of that class
which, throughout her reign, was destined to hold the balance
of political power in its hands. Behind lay a deep sense of
religion, the religion which centres in the belief in the Fatherhood
of God, and is impatient of dogmatic distinctions and
subtleties.</p>

<h2  style="margin-top: 5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">CHAPTER III</h2>

<h5>QUEEN VICTORIA'S RELATIONS AND FRIENDS</h5>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="sc">It</span> may be held to have been one of the chief blessings of Queen
<span class="rightnote">THE KING OF THE BELGIANS</span>
Victoria's girlhood that she was brought closely under the influence
of an enlightened and large-minded Prince, Leopold,
her maternal uncle, afterwards King of the Belgians. He was
born in 1790, being the youngest son of Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld,
and his youth was spent in the Russian
military service. He had shown talent and courage in the
field, and had commanded a battalion at L&uuml;tzen and Leipsic.
He had married, in 1816, the Princess Charlotte, only child of
George IV. For many years his home was at Claremont,
where the Princess Charlotte had died; there the Princess
Victoria spent many happy holidays, and grew to regard her
uncle with the most devoted affection, almost, indeed, in the
light of a father. It is said that Prince Leopold had hoped to
be named Regent, if a Regency should be necessary.<sup>1</sup> He was
offered, and accepted, the throne of Greece in 1830, but shrank
from the difficulties of the position, and withdrew his acceptance
upon the plea that Lord Aberdeen, who was then Foreign
Secretary, was not prepared to make such financial arrangements
as he considered satisfactory.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p class="footnote">Footnote 1: A practical proof of his interest in his niece may be found in the fact that for years
he contributed between three and four thousand a year to the expenses of her education,
and for necessary holidays by the sea, at a time when the Duchess of Kent's Parliamentary
Grant was unequal to the increasing expenses of her household.</p>

<p class="footnote">Footnote 2: Greece after having obtained autonomy was in a practically bankrupt condition, and
the Powers had guaranteed the financial credit of the country until it was able to develop
its own resources.
</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe from the correspondence that
King Leopold seems for many years to have continued to
regret his decision; it was not that he did not devote himself,
heart and soul, to the country of his adoption, but there seems
to have been a romantic element in his composition, which did
not find its full satisfaction in presiding over the destinies of a
peaceful commercial nation.</p>

<p>In 1831, when Louis Philippe, under pressure from Lord
Palmerston, declined the throne of Belgium for his son the Duc
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.23" id="pagei.23"></a>[page&nbsp;23]</span>
de Nemours, Prince Leopold received and accepted an offer
of the Crown. A Dutch invasion followed, and the new King
showed great courage and gallantry in an engagement near
Louvain, in which his army was hopelessly outnumbered.
But, though a sensitive man, the King's high courage and
hopefulness never deserted him. He ruled his country with
diligence, ability, and wisdom, and devoted himself to encouraging
manufactures and commerce. The result of his
firm and liberal rule was manifested in 1848, when, on his
offering to resign the Crown if it was thought to be for the best
interests of the country, he was entreated, with universal
acclamation, to retain the sovereignty. Belgium passed
through the troubled years of revolution in comparative tranquillity.
King Leopold was a model ruler; his deportment
was grave and serious; he was conspicuous for honesty and
integrity; he was laborious and upright, and at the same
time conciliatory and tactful.</p>

<p>He kept up a close correspondence with Queen Victoria, and
paid her several visits in England, where he was on intimate
terms with many leading Englishmen. It would be difficult to
over-estimate the importance of his close relations with the
Queen; by example and precept he inspired her with a high
sense of duty, and from the first instilled into her mind the
necessity of acquainting herself closely with the details of
political administration. His wisdom, good sense, and tenderness,
as well as the close tie of blood that existed between him
and the Queen, placed him in a unique position with regard
to her, and it is plain that he was fully aware of the high
responsibility thus imposed upon him, which he accepted with
a noble generosity. It is true that there were occasions when,
as the correspondence reveals, the Queen was disposed to think
that King Leopold endeavoured to exercise too minute a control
over her in matters of detail, and even to attempt to
modify the foreign policy of England rather for the benefit of
Belgium than in the best interests of Great Britain; but the
Queen was equal to these emergencies; she expressed her
dissent from the King's suggestions in considerate and affectionate
terms, with her gratitude for his advice, but made no
pretence of following it.</p>

<span class="rightnote">QUEEN ADELAIDE</span>

<p>For her aunt, Queen Adelaide, the Princess Victoria had
always felt a strong affection; and though it can hardly be
said that this gentle and benevolent lady exercised any great
influence over her more vigorous and impetuous niece, yet the
letters will testify to the closeness of the tie which united them.</p>

<p>Queen Adelaide was the eldest child of George, Duke of
Saxe-Meiningen; her mother was a princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.24" id="pagei.24"></a>[page&nbsp;24]</span>

<p>At the age of twenty-six she was married to the
Duke of Clarence, then in his fifty-third year, without any
preliminary courtship. They lived for a year in Hanover, and
then principally at Bushey Park. Two daughters were born
to them, the elder of whom lived only a few hours; the younger,
Princess Elizabeth, died in the first year of her age. Their
married life was a happy one, in spite of the disparity of age.
Queen Adelaide was a woman of a deeply affectionate disposition,
sensible, sympathetic, and religious. She had a very
definite ideal of the duties of a wife and a Queen; she made it
her pleasure to meet and anticipate, as far as possible, her
husband's wishes; and her husband, hasty and choleric though
he was, repaid her with tender affection. To such an extent
did the Queen merge her views in those of her husband, that
she passed at one time through a period of general unpopularity.
It was believed that she was adverse to Reform, and
used her influence against it. She was mobbed in the streets
at the time when the Reform agitation was at its height; and
it is said that when the Melbourne Ministry of 1834 was dismissed,
London was (owing to an unjustifiable communication
of Lord Brougham to the <i>Times</i>) placarded with posters bearing
the words, "The Queen has done it all!"</p>

<p>It is a pathetic instance of the irony of fate that Queen
Adelaide should have thus been supposed to desire to take an
active part in politics. It is obvious, from her letters, that
she had practically no political views at all, except a gentle
distrust of all proposed changes, social or political. Her one
idea of her position as Queen was to agree with any expression
of opinion that fell from the King. She was fond of music, and
took a deep interest in her religious duties and in all that concerned
the welfare of the Protestant communion. But apart
from this, her interests were entirely domestic and personal,
and her letters reveal her character in the most amiable light.
Her devotion to the King, and the tender and respectful diffidence
with which she welcomed her niece to the Throne, show
a very sweet nature.</p>

<p>The rest of her life, after King William's death, was passed
to a great extent under invalid conditions, though she was only
forty-four at the time of her niece's accession. She travelled a
good deal in search of health, and lived a quiet life in England,
surrounded by a small but devoted circle of friends and relations.
Her personal popularity with the nation became very
great, not only for the simple kindliness of her life, but for her
splendid munificence; it is said that her public subscriptions
often exceeded &pound;20,000 a year. She died in December 1849.
Queen Victoria was very much attached to her gentle, simple-minded,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.25" id="pagei.25"></a>[page&nbsp;25]</span>
and tender-hearted aunt, and treated her with the
utmost consideration and an almost daughterly affection.</p>

<span class="rightnote">BARONESS LEHZEN</span>

<p>Another person who had a large share in forming the Queen's
character was Louise Lehzen, the daughter of a Hanoverian
clergyman, who came to England as governess to Princess
Feodore of Leiningen, Queen Victoria's half-sister, shortly
before the Queen's birth. In 1824 she became governess to the
Princess Victoria. In 1827 George IV. conferred upon her the
rank of a Hanoverian Baroness. When the Duchess of Northumberland,
in 1830, was appointed the Princess's official
governess, she remained as lady in attendance. The Princess
was devoted to her, but "greatly in awe of her." She remained
at Court after the accession till 1842, without holding an official
position, and then returned to Germany, where she died in 1870.</p>

<span class="rightnote">BARON STOCKMAR</span>

<p>Baron Stockmar was another of the interesting personalities
who came into very close contact with the Queen in her early
years. He was forty-nine at the time of the accession, but he
had come to England more than twenty years before as private
physician to Prince Leopold. He endeared himself to the
Princess Charlotte, who died holding his hand. He afterwards
became Prince Leopold's private secretary, and took a prominent
part as the Prince's representative in the successive negotiations
with regard to his candidature for the thrones of
Greece and Belgium. Upon the accession of Queen Victoria,
Stockmar joined the Court in a private capacity, and for fifteen
months he held an unofficial position as her chief adviser.
There was a general feeling of dislike in the minds of the
English public to the German influences that were supposed
to be brought to bear on the Queen; and Lord Melbourne
found it necessary to make a public and categorical denial of
the statement that Stockmar was acting as the Queen's private
secretary. But the statement, if not technically, was virtually
true. Stockmar lived at Court, had interviews with the Queen
and her Ministers, and though he industriously endeavoured to
efface himself, yet there is no doubt that he was consulted on
most important questions. In 1838, he had been entrusted by
King Leopold, with the Queen's knowledge and consent, with
a mission of great delicacy: he was asked to accompany Prince
Albert on a tour in Italy, with the idea of completing his education,
and in order to satisfy himself that the Prince would be a
worthy Consort for the Queen. This task he discharged admirably,
and became the most confidential and trusted of all
the Prince's friends. There are many letters of Stockmar's to
the Prince extant, which prove that Stockmar never shrank
from speaking the plainest truth to the Prince on matters of
duty and faults of temperament, without any courtier-like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.26" id="pagei.26"></a>[page&nbsp;26]</span>
attempt to blink criticism that might have been unpalatable.
The Prince had the generosity and humility to value this trait
of Stockmar's very highly, to such an extent that Stockmar's
influence possessed if anything too great a preponderance.
Stockmar had jealously nursed two profound political ideals&mdash;the
unity of Germany under Prussia, and the establishment of
close relations between Germany and England. He induced
Prince Albert, heavily burdened as he was with work, to
devote almost too much time and thought to the former of
these aims. Stockmar was a profound student of social and
constitutional questions. He had made a close study of
English political institutions; but though he grasped the
constitutional theory of the English Throne, and saw that the
first necessity for the Sovereign was to hold a position independent
of party, he never clearly understood that the Monarch
should keep as far as possible clear of political details. Stockmar's
view of the position was that the Sovereign should be
practically Premier as well; and much of the jealousy that was
felt, on various occasions, at the position which Prince Albert
assumed with regard to political situations, is referable to
Stockmar's influence.</p>

<p>He was a very able man, with immense political knowledge,
and without personal ambition; Lord Palmerston, who was no
friend to Stockmar's theory of government, admitted that he
was the most disinterested man he had ever encountered.
Stockmar's ambition was to achieve his own political ideals, and
to modify the course of events in what he conceived to be
beneficial directions; he was entirely indifferent to the trappings
of power, and this very disinterestedness made his
influence more supreme.</p>

<p>He suffered all his life from feeble health and a hypochondriacal
tendency, and was genuinely fond of retirement and
quiet life. He certainly deserved the devoted confidence
reposed in him by Prince Albert and the Queen; it may
perhaps be questioned whether his own <i>doctrinaire</i> bias did not
make itself too strongly felt, in the minuteness with which
Prince Albert dealt with English politics; but the net result
of his influence was that the danger, which lies in wait for
strictly constitutional Sovereigns, was averted&mdash;the danger,
that is, of leaving the administration of State affairs in the
hands of specialists, and depriving it of the wise control and
independent criticism which only the Crown can adequately

<h3  style="margin-top: 5em;">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>

<h3 style="margin-top: -0.5em;">TO CHAPTER IV</h3>


<p><span class="sc">Queen Victoria</span>, from the very first, took great pleasure in filing
the correspondence addressed to her. There are many volumes of
letters received from her various relations. We have thought it best
to give some of Queen Adelaide's early letters; they indicate in a remarkable
manner the growing estrangement between King William
IV. and the Duchess of Kent. In the earlier letters the King enquires
very affectionately after the Duchess, and constant mention is
made of presents sent to her; but the references made to her become
less frequent and colder, till at last the King contents himself with
sending messages only to the Princess. But the letters of Queen
Adelaide are always written in a strain of touching devotion and
affection, and reveal her as a woman of large heart and great simplicity
of character.</p>

<span class="rightnote">KING LEOPOLD</span>

<p>But the most interesting series of letters are the Queen's own
correspondence with King Leopold, of which several hundred are
preserved. The letters, too, received by her from the King of
the Belgians are preserved in their entirety.</p>

<p>The letters which the Queen wrote to King Leopold are of extraordinary
interest; she kept up an unbroken correspondence with
him, and spoke freely of all that was in her mind. Two points are
worthy of special mention: though she was early convinced of the
necessity of holding an independent constitutional position in politics
she mentions the Tory party with undisguised mistrust; and further,
the name of King William hardly ever occurs until his last illness.</p>

<p>King Leopold's early letters reveal his character in the most
amiable light. He familiarised the Queen with all the complicated
details of foreign politics; he gave her the most sensible and wise advice;
he warned and encouraged her; he answered her enquiries with
the minutest care: and the warm affection to which he gave frequent
expression is a very sacred and beautiful thing to contemplate.</p>

<p>We have selected several of the Princess Victoria's letters to the
King of the Belgians before her accession, because they throw a remarkable
light upon her temperament. In the first place, they
reveal the deep affectionateness of her character, and, what is still
more remarkable at her age, her frankness and outspokenness in
expressing her feelings.</p>

<p>In the second place, they show with what interest and eagerness
the Princess was following the course of foreign politics. Her view
was naturally a personal one, but it may be said that there can have
been very few, if any, girls in England, of the Princess's age, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.28" id="pagei.28"></a>[page&nbsp;28]</span>
were taking any interest at all in Continental affairs. It is true that
King Leopold had early impressed upon the Princess that it was a
duty to become acquainted with the course of current events; but the
letters show that the interest she felt was congenial and innate, and
did not spring from a sense of duty. The allusions to home politics
are not so frequent, but still show that here also her attention was
alert.</p>

<p>Thirdly, they reveal her abounding vitality, her love of life and
amusement, her devotion to music, and the simple unspoilt zest
with which she threw herself into all that surrounded her.</p>

<p>There is a special interest which attaches to the correspondence
between Queen Victoria and King Leopold after the Accession. The
letters reveal, as no other documents could do, the monarchical point
of view. However intimate may be the relations between a Sovereign
and a subject, there is bound to appear a certain discretion, and
even condescension, on the one hand, and on the other a due degree
of deference. But here we have the remarkable spectacle of two
monarchs, both of eminent sagacity, and both, so to speak, frankly
interested in the task of constitutional government, corresponding
freely on all the difficulties and problems inseparable from their momentous
task, and with an immense sense of their weighty responsibilities.
It is impossible to exaggerate the deep and abiding interest
of such a correspondence; and the seriousness, the devotion, the
public spirit that are displayed, without affectation or calculated impressiveness,
make the whole series of letters singularly memorable.</p>

<p>The King of the Belgians had married Princess Louise of Orleans,
daughter of Louis Philippe, in 1832. She was only seven years older
than the Princess Victoria, who grew to regard her with the tenderest
affection.</p>

<p>The letters from Queen Louise are very numerous. A few are in
French, but they are mostly written in brisk, lively English, not always
very correct, either in construction or in spelling. They are full
of small family details&mdash;the movements of various relations, the improvement
in her brothers' looks, Court festivities, the childish
ailments of her little boys, the journeys and expeditions, recollections
of Windsor, their visitors, elaborate descriptions of dresses&mdash;interesting
to read, but difficult to select from. They are full of heart-felt
expressions of the sincerest affection for "your dear Majesty," a
quaint phrase that often occurs.</p>

<span class="rightnote">PRINCE ALBERT</span>

<p>After their marriage in 1840, Prince Albert naturally became the
Queen's confidential Secretary.</p>

<p>A close study of the Queen's correspondence reveals the character
of the Prince in a way which nothing else could effect. Traces of his
untiring labour, his conscientious vigilance, his singular devotedness,
appear on every page. There are innumerable memoranda in his
own hand; the papers are throughout arranged and annotated by
him; nothing seems to have escaped him, nothing to have dismayed
him. As an instance of the minute laboriousness which characterised
the Royal household, it may be mentioned that there are many
copies of important letters, forwarded to the Prince for his perusal,
the originals of which had to be returned, written not only by the
Prince himself, but by the Queen under his direction. But besides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.29" id="pagei.29"></a>[page&nbsp;29]</span>
keeping a vigilant eye upon politics, the Prince took the lead in all
social and educational movements of the time, as well as devoting a
close and continuous attention to the affairs of Europe in general, and
Germany in particular. It is obvious from the papers that the
Prince can hardly ever have taken a holiday; many hours of every
day must have been devoted by him to work; yet he was at the
same time a tender husband and father, always ready with advice
and sympathy, and devoted to quiet domestic life.</p>

<p>After the Queen's marriage the correspondence becomes far more
voluminous. It is difficult to exaggerate the amount of conscientious
labour bestowed by the Queen and the Prince Consort on all matters
which concerned the welfare of the nation. The number of documents
which passed through their hands, and which were carefully
studied by them, was prodigious.</p>

<p>The drafts of the Queen's replies to letters are in many cases in the
handwriting of the Prince Consort, but dated by herself, and often
containing interlinear corrections and additions of her own. Whether
the Queen indicated the lines of the replies, whether she dictated the
substance of them, or whether they contain the result of a discussion
on the particular matter, cannot be precisely ascertained. But they
contain so many phrases and turns of expression which are characteristic
of her outspoken temperament, that it is clear that she not only
followed every detail, but that the substance of the communication
bore in most cases the impress of her mind. A considerable number
of the drafts again are in her own hand, with interlinear corrections
and additions by the Prince; and these so strongly resemble in style
the drafts in the handwriting of the Prince, that it is clear that the
Queen did not merely accept suggestions, but that she had a strong
opinion of her own on important matters, and that this opinion was
duly expressed.</p>

<p>One fact must, however, be borne in mind. It happens in many
cases that a correspondence on some particular point seems to be
about to lead up to a definite conclusion, but that the salient and
decisive document is absent. In these cases it is clear that the
matter was settled at a personal interview; in many cases the
Prince prepared a memorandum of an important interview; but
there are a considerable number of such correspondences, where no
record is preserved of the eventual solution, and this incompleteness
is regrettable, but, by the nature of the case, inevitable.</p>


<span class="rightnote">LEADING STATESMEN IN 1837</span>

<p>The young Queen, on coming to the Throne, had little technical
knowledge of the details of diplomacy, but she already had a real and
intelligent acquaintance with foreign affairs, though it was rather
personal than political, and, as we have seen, was more inspired by
her interest in the fortunes and position of her numerous maternal
relations than by the political views of her paternal relatives. Among
the English statesmen of the day there were few who were qualified
to help and instruct her. The two men who for over twenty years
alternately guided the foreign policy of the country were Lord Aberdeen
and Lord Palmerston. They represented two opposed schools.
Lord Aberdeen, a Peelite, was naturally and by tradition inclined to
desire harmonious relations with all foreign Powers, and to abstain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.30" id="pagei.30"></a>[page&nbsp;30]</span>
as far as was consistent with maintaining British interests, from
any sort of intervention in European affairs; Palmerston was a
disciple of Canning, who had definitely broken with the principles
of the Congress of Vienna, and openly avowed his approval of a
policy of intervention, to any extent short of actual war, in the
interests of liberty and good government. The only other man
who had any title to speak with authority on foreign affairs was the
Duke of Wellington, who had held the seals as Foreign Secretary for
a few months in 1834 and 1835. He had, however, lost much of the
reputation for political sagacity which he had held at the time when
he was the arbiter of Europe and virtual ruler of France. Moreover,
being, as he was, a much occupied man, with varied business to transact,
and at the mercy of his almost excessive conscientiousness, he
held himself to a considerable extent aloof from current politics,
though he never lost his absorbing interest in Continental affairs.</p>

description of your new Aunt.<sup>11</sup> I therefore shall both mentally
and physically describe her to you.</p>

<p class="ind">She is extremely gentle and amiable, her actions are always
guided by principles. She is at all times ready and disposed
to sacrifice her comfort and inclinations to see others happy.
She values goodness, merit, and virtue much more than beauty,
riches, and amusements. With all this she is highly informed
and very clever; she speaks and writes English, German and
Italian; she speaks English very well indeed. In short, my
dear Love, you see that I may well recommend her as an
example for all young ladies, being Princesses or not.</p>

<p class="ind">Now to her appearance. She is about Feodore's height, her
hair very fair, light blue eyes, of a very gentle, intelligent and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.35" id="pagei.35"></a>[page&nbsp;35]</span>
kind expression. A Bourbon nose and small mouth. The
figure is much like Feodore's but rather less stout. She rides
very well, which she proved to my great alarm the other day,
by keeping her seat though a horse of mine ran away with her
full speed for at least half a mile. What she does particularly
well is dancing. Music unfortunately she is not very fond of,
though she plays on the harp; I believe there is some idleness
in the case. There exists already great confidence and affection
between us; she is desirous of doing everything that can
contribute to my happiness, and I study whatever can make
her happy and contented.</p>

<p class="ind">You will see by these descriptions that though my good
little wife is not the tallest Queen, she is a very great prize
which I highly value and cherish....</p>

<span class="rightnote">A BIRTHDAY LETTER</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Laeken</span>, <i>21st May 1833</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Love</span>,&mdash;To make quite sure of my birthday
congratulations reaching you on that day, I send them by
to-day's messenger, and confide them to the care of your
illustrious mother.</p>

<p class="ind">My sincere good wishes for many happy returns of that day
which gave you, dear little soul, to us, will be accompanied by
some few reflections, which the serious aspect of our times calls
forth. My dearest Love, you are now fourteen years old, a
period when the delightful pastimes of childhood must be
mixed with thoughts appertaining already to a matured part
of your life. I know that you have been very studious, but
now comes the time when the judgment must form itself, when
the character requires attention; in short when the young tree
takes the shape which it retains afterwards through life.</p>
<span class="rightnote">VALUABLE ADVICE</span>
<p class="ind">To attain this object it is indispensable to give some little
time <i>to reflection</i>. The life in a great town is little calculated
for such purposes; however, with some firmness of purpose it
can be done.</p>

<p class="ind"><i>Self-examination</i> is the most important part of the business,
and a very useful mode of proceeding is, for instance, every
evening to recapitulate the events of the day, and the motives
which made one act oneself, as well as to try to guess what
might have been the motives of others. Amiable dispositions
like yours will easily perceive if your own motives <i>were good</i>.
Persons in high situations must particularly guard themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.36" id="pagei.36"></a>[page&nbsp;36]</span>
against selfishness and vanity. An individual in a high and
important situation will easily see a great many persons eager
to please the first, and to flatter and encourage the last. Selfishness,
however, makes the individual itself miserable, and is
the cause of constant disappointment, besides being the surest
means of being disliked by everybody.</p>

<p class="ind">Vanity, on the other hand, is generally artfully used by
ambitious and interested people to make one a tool for purposes
of their own, but too often in opposition with one's own
happiness and destruction of it.</p>

<p class="ind">To learn to know oneself, to judge oneself with truth and
impartiality, must be the great objects of one's exertion;
they are only attainable by constant and cool self-examination.</p>

<p class="ind">The position of what is generally called great people has of
late become extremely difficult. They are more attacked and
calumniated, and judged with less indulgence than private
individuals. What they have lost in this way, they have not
by any means regained in any other. Ever since the revolution
of 1790 they are much less secure than they used to be, and the
transition from sovereign power to <i>absolute want</i> has been as
frequent as sudden.</p>

<p class="ind">It becomes, therefore, necessary that the character should be
so formed as not to be intoxicated by greatness and success,
nor cast down by misfortune. To be able to do so, one must
be able to appreciate things according to their real value, and
particularly avoid giving to trifles an undue importance.</p>

<p class="ind">Nothing is so great and clear a proof of unfitness for greater
and nobler actions, than a mind which is seriously occupied
with trifles.</p>

<p class="ind">Trifling matters may be objects of amusement and relaxation
to a clever person, but only a weak mind and a mean spirit
consider trifles as important. The good sense must show itself
by distinguishing what is and what is not important.</p>

<p class="ind">My sermon is now long enough, my dear child. I strongly
recommend it, however, to your reflection and consideration.</p>

<p class="ind">My gift consists in a set of views of the former Kingdom of
the Netherlands, out of which you will be able to discover all
those of the present Belgium.</p>

<p class="ind">Let me soon hear from you; and may God bless and preserve
you. Ever, my dear Love, your affectionate Uncle,</p>

acquaintance. I am delighted to hear that dear Aunt has
benefited from the sea air and bathing. We had a very pretty
party to Hever Castle yesterday, which perhaps you remember,
where Anne Boleyn used to live, <i>before she lost her head</i>. We
drove there, and rode home. It was a most beautiful day.
We have very good accounts from dear Feodore, who will, by
this time, be at Langenburg.</p>

<span class="rightnote">HISTORICAL READING</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Laeken</span>, <i>18th October 1834</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Love</span>,&mdash;I am happy to learn that Tunbridge
Wells has done you good. Health is the first and most important
gift of Providence; without it we are poor, miserable
creatures, though the whole earth were our property; therefore
I trust that you will take great care of your own. I feel
convinced that air and exercise are most useful for you. In
your leisure moments I hope that you study a little; history is
what I think the most important study for you. It will be
difficult for you to learn human-kind's ways and manners
otherwise than from that important source of knowledge.
Your position will more or less render practical knowledge
extremely difficult for you, till you get old, and still if you do
not prepare yourself for your position, you may become the
victim of wicked and designing people, particularly at a period
when party spirit runs so high. Our times resemble most
those of the Protestant reformation; then people were moved
by religious opinions, as they now undoubtedly are by political
passions. Unfortunately history is rarely written by those who
really were the chief movers of events, nor free from a party
colouring; this is particularly the case in the works about
English history. In that respect France is much richer, because
there we have authenticated memoirs of some of the
most important men, and of others who really saw what passed
and wrote it down at the time. Political feelings, besides,
rarely created <i>permanent</i> parties like those in England, with the
exception, perhaps, of the great distinctions of Catholics and
Protestants. What I most should recommend is the period
before the accession of Henry IV. of France to the throne, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.38" id="pagei.38"></a>[page&nbsp;38]</span>
the events after his death till the end of the minority of
Louis XIV.; after that period, though interesting, matters
have a character which is more personal, and therefore less
applicable to the present times. Still even that period may be
studied with some profit to get knowledge of mankind. <i>Intrigues</i>
and <i>favouritism</i> were the chief features of that period,
and Madame de Maintenon's immense influence was very
nearly the cause of the destruction of France. What I very
particularly recommend to you is to study in the Memoirs
of the great and good Sully<sup>12</sup> the last years of the reign of
Henry IV. of France, and the events which followed his assassination.
If you have not got the work, I will forward it
to you from hence, or give you the edition which I must have
at Claremont.</p>

<p class="ind">As my paper draws to a close, I shall finish also by giving you
my best blessings, and remain ever, my dearest Love, your
faithfully attached Friend and Uncle,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Leopold R.</span></p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 12: Maximilien, Duc de Sully, was Henry's Minister of Finance. A curious feature of the
Memoirs is the fact that they are written in the second person: the historian recounts
the hero's adventures to him.

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Uncle</span>,&mdash;You cannot conceive how happy you
have made me, by your very kind letter, which, instead of
tiring, delights me beyond everything. I must likewise say
how very grateful I feel for the kind and excellent advice you
gave me in it.</p>

<p class="ind">For the autographs I beg to return my best thanks. They
are most valuable and interesting, and will be great additions
to my collections. As I have not got Sully's Memoirs, I shall
be delighted if you will be so good as to give them to me.
Reading history is one of my greatest delights, and perhaps,
dear Uncle, you might like to know which books in that line I
am now reading. In my lessons with the Dean of Chester,<sup>13</sup> I
am reading Russell's <i>Modern Europe</i>,<sup>14</sup> which is very interesting,
and Clarendon's <i>History of the Rebellion</i>. It is drily written,
but is full of instruction. I like reading different authors, of
different opinions, by which means I learn not to lean on one
particular side. Besides my lessons, I read Jones'<sup>15</sup> account of
the wars in Spain, Portugal and the South of France, from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.39" id="pagei.39"></a>[page&nbsp;39]</span>
year 1808 till 1814. It is well done, I think, and amuses me
very much. In French, I am now in <i>La Rivalit&eacute; de la France
et de l'Espagne</i>, par Gaillard,<sup>16</sup> which is very interesting. I have
also begun Rollin.<sup>17</sup> I am very fond of making tables of the
Kings and Queens, as I go on, and I have lately finished one of
the English Sovereigns and their consorts, as, of course, the
history of my own country is one of my first duties. I should
be fearful of tiring you with so long an account of myself, were
I not sure you take so great an interest in my welfare.</p>

by a very kind letter from you, and a beautiful shawl,
which will be most useful to me, particularly as a favourite one

many reasons, but also to be an eye-witness of my extreme

<i>3rd August 1835</i>.</p>
<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dear Love</span>,&mdash;By your Mother's letter of the 31st ult<sup>o</sup>., I
learned of the serious and important action in your young life<sup>20</sup>
which has passed recently, and I cannot let it pass without saying
some words on the subject. I am perhaps rather strangely
situated for a preaching&mdash;somewhat in the style of those old
camp preachers who held forth to many thousand people on
some heath in Scotland. I am also on an immense heath,
surrounded by 16,000 men, mostly young and gay, cooking,
singing, working, and not very like the stern old Covenanters;
however, I shall try. First of all, let me congratulate you that
it passed happily and well off. Secondly, let me entreat you to
look with a serious and reflective mind on the day which is past.
Many are the religions, many the shades of those religions, but
it must be confessed the principles of the Christian religion are
the most perfect and the most beautiful that can be imagined....
There is one virtue which is particularly Christian; this
is the knowledge of our own heart in <i>real humility</i>. <i>Hypocrisy</i>
is a besetting sin of all times, but <i>particularly of the present</i>, and
many are the wolves in sheep's clothes. I am sorry to say, with
all my affection for old England, the very <i>state of its Society and
politics</i> renders many in that country <i>essentially humbugs and
deceivers</i>; the <i>appearance</i> of the thing is generally <i>more</i>
considered than the <i>reality</i>; provided matters go off well, and
opinion may be gained, the <i>real good is matter of the most perfect
indifference</i>. Defend yourself, my dear love, against this
system; let your dear character always be true and loyal;
this does not <i>exclude prudence</i>&mdash;worldly concerns are now unfortunately
so organised that you <i>must be cautious</i> or you may
injure yourself and others&mdash;but it does not prevent the being
sterling and true. Nothing in persons gives greater reliance,
greater weight, than when they are known to be <i>true</i>.
<span class="rightnote">HONESTY AND SINCERITY</span>
From your earliest childhood I was anxious to see in you this important
virtue <i>saved</i> and <i>developed</i>, and Lehzen will still be able to
recollect that. If it is God's pleasure that you should once<sup>21</sup>
fill the arduous situation to which you seem destined, you will
find the importance of what I now say to you. And when
others may tremble to have at last their real character found
out, and to meet all the contempt which they may deserve,
your mind and heart will be still and happy, because it will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.42" id="pagei.42"></a>[page&nbsp;42]</span>
know that it acts honestly, that truth and goodness are the
motives of its actions. I press you now against my heart;
may God bless you as I wish and hope it, and may you always
feel some affection for your sincerely devoted camp preacher
and Uncle,</p>

<h3  style="margin-top: 5em;">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>

<h3 style="margin-top: -0.5em;">TO CHAPTER V</h3>


<p><span class="sc">The</span> year 1836 was not an eventful one at home; the Whig Ministry
were too weak to carry measures of first-rate importance,
and could hardly have maintained themselves in power against the
formidable opposition of Sir Robert Peel without the support of
O'Connell. Parliament was chiefly occupied by the consideration
of the Secret Societies in Ireland, Tithes, Municipal Corporations,
and such matters; the Marriage Act, and the Act for the Registration
of Births have probably been the most important measures of
the year to the country. Troubles which were destined to become
more acute arose in Lower Canada and Jamaica, both taking the
form of disputes between the executive and the legislature.</p>

<p>On the continent of Europe, affairs were more disturbing. Several
attempts were made on the life of the King of the French, while an
abortive insurrection with a view of establishing a military empire
was made by Louis Bonaparte at Strasburg. The Prince was allowed
to leave the country and go to the United States, but his accomplices
were detained for trial. In Algiers the French Government determined
to prosecute operations against the Arab Chief Abd-el-Kader,
and they sent an expedition to Constantin.</p>

<p>Holland and Belgium were occupied with a dispute about their
boundary line, the cession to Belgium of Luxemburg being the chief
point of difference. The difficulties that arose in passing an important
Municipal Act for Belgium caused King Leopold temporarily
to regret he had not accepted the throne of Greece.</p>

<p>Portugal was still convulsed by revolutionary agitation. Dom
Pedro, the eldest son of King John VI., had been proclaimed Emperor
of Brazil in his father's lifetime, and had abdicated the throne
of Portugal in favour of his daughter Donna Maria, a child seven
years old, while Dom Miguel, his younger brother, who had acted in
opposition to his father in Portugal, claimed the throne for himself.
Dom Pedro had agreed that his daughter should marry Miguel, who
was in 1827 appointed Regent. Miguel, had he acted wisely, might
have maintained himself on the throne, but Dom Pedro, who had
been expelled from Brazil by a revolution, took active steps to recover
the Portuguese throne for his daughter, and equipped an
expedition for that end with English and French volunteers. In
this way, Donna Maria, who had spent part of her exile in England,
and formed a friendship with the Princess Victoria, was through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.44" id="pagei.44"></a>[page&nbsp;44]</span>
British instrumentality placed on her throne, but still could only
maintain herself with difficulty against Miguel. She was a few weeks
older than the Princess Victoria, and had recently lost her first
husband, the Duc de Leuchtenberg. She was married by proxy
on the 1st of January 1836, and in person on the 9th of April, to
Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg.</p>

<p>There was also a disputed succession in Spain, where by the
ancient law women might succeed to the throne. Ferdinand VII.,
who had revoked the Pragmatic Sanction of 1711 and restored the
former system, died in 1833, leaving no son. His elder daughter
Isabella, then three years of age, was proclaimed Queen (her mother
Christina being appointed Regent), and Isabella's claims were
recognised by England and France. The late King's brother, Don
Carlos, taking his stand upon the Salic Law as established by the
Pragmatic Sanction, raised the standard of revolt and allied himself
with Dom Miguel, the young Queens Maria and Isabella mutually
recognising each other, and being supported by France and England
against the "Holy Alliance" of Austria, Russia, and Prussia. A
seven years' civil war resulted, which did not end till, from sheer
exhaustion, the Carlists had to cease fighting the Christinos, as the
loyal party was called. The English Government in the previous
year had sanctioned the enlistment of 10,000 men; who, commanded
by Colonel (afterwards Sir de Lacy) Evans, landed at San Sebastian
in August to assist the Christinos. A British auxiliary contingent
was already with the Spanish army, while a naval squadron under
Lord John Hay was active on the coast. Mendizabal was Prime
Minister at the beginning of the year 1836, and was succeeded in
May by Isturitz. Riots took place at Madrid, and Isturitz fled to
France; Calatrava succeeding him, assisted by Mendizabal. The
Christino cause did not much advance during the year.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearly beloved Child</span>,&mdash;You wrote me again a long,
<i>dear</i>, <i>good</i> letter, like all those which I received from your kind
hands. Time approaches now for the arrival of the cousins,
and most probably of your Uncle Ferdinand also. He has informed
me of his arrival for the 7th or 8th; notwithstanding
this, I mean to leave everything settled as it has been arranged.
They will set off on the 7th, arrive at Paris on the 8th, and leave
it again on the 12th.... Fernando<sup>1</sup> has still a very bad cold;
change of air is likely to cure that. The stay here has done
Fernando a great deal of good, and it cannot be denied that he
is quite another person. It has given me some trouble, but I
have written down for him everything which he ought to know
about the organisation of a government <i>in general</i>, and what
will be necessary in specie to carry on successfully the Government
in Portugal.... My inclinations, as you are aware,
would have led me to the East, but certainly the only thing
which reconciles me with my not having done so is that it has
made me to remain near you, and will enable me to see you and
to be useful to you.</p>

me very happy; I only wish they could have lasted longer, for
all, all is over now, and our <i>beloved</i> Ferdinand<sup>2</sup> himself leaves
our shores this <i>very</i> morning. We accompanied them all on
Sunday, where we took a final leave of our dear Ferdinand, and
I cannot tell you how sorry I was, and am, to see him go, for I
love him dearly. He is so truly excellent, kind, and good, and
endears himself so much by his simplicity and good-heartedness!
I may venture to say, that no one has his prosperity
and happiness more at heart than I have. I am extremely
sanguine about his success. He goes there full of courage,
spirits, and goodwill, and being naturally clever and observant,
I doubt not that with good counsel, and prudence, he will do
very well. <i>Your</i> kind advice will be of the greatest and most
important use to him, the more so as he is so exceedingly fond

success of our dear Ferdinand. All has gone off better than

and M. de Neumann says that they are already quite happy
together. This is really a great blessing, but I fear that all the

and reasoning in them. As you say, very truly, it is extremely

so impartially. I am always both grateful and happy when
you give me any advice, and hope you will continue to do so

a former letter about your visiting us again. You know, dear
Uncle, that this is a subject upon which I am very <i>earnest</i>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Child</span>,&mdash;I got this time a very small letter
from your good little Ladyship, and I shall repay it probably
in larger coin, as my letter going through a messenger of my
own will become longer, as it will be more confidential than
through the usual mode of conveyance.</p>

<p class="ind">I am really <i>astonished</i> at the conduct of your old Uncle the
King; this invitation of the Prince of Orange and his sons,
this forcing him upon others, is very extraordinary.<sup>4</sup> It is so,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.48" id="pagei.48"></a>[page&nbsp;48]</span>
because persons in political stations and champions of great
political passions cannot put aside their known character as
you would lay your hat upon a table.</p>

<p class="ind">Not later than yesterday I got a half official communication
from England, insinuating that it would be <i>highly</i> desirable
that the visit of <i>your</i> relatives <i>should not take place, this
year&mdash;qu'en dites-vous</i>? The relations of the Queen and the King,
therefore, to the God-knows-what degree, are to come in shoals
and rule the land, when <i>your relations</i> are to be <i>forbidden</i> the
country, and that when, as you know, the whole of your relations
have ever been very dutiful and kind to the King.
Really and truly I never heard or saw anything like it, and I
hope it will a <i>little rouse your spirit</i>; now that slavery is even
abolished in the British Colonies, I do not comprehend <i>why
your lot alone should be to be kept, a white little slavey in England</i>,
for the pleasure of the Court, who never bought you, as I am
not aware of their having gone to any expense on that head, or
the King's even having <i>spent a sixpence for your existence</i>. I
expect that my visits in England will also be prohibited by
an Order in Council. Oh consistency and political or <i>other
honesty</i>, where must one look for you!</p>

<p class="ind">I have not the least doubt that the King, in his passion for
the Oranges, will be <i>excessively rude to your relations</i>; this,
however, will not signify much; they are <i>your guests</i> and not
<i>his</i>, and will therefore <i>not</i> mind it....</p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 4: King Leopold had for some time cherished a hope of uniting the
Princess Victoria in marriage with her cousin, Prince Albert of Coburg. He therefore arranged that
the Prince, with his elder brother, Prince Ernest, should pay a visit to the Duchess
of Kent at Kensington Palace. King William naturally opposed a scheme which he knew met
with the approval of his sister-in-law. He accordingly invited the Prince of
Orange and his two sons at the same time, and favoured the candidature of the younger son,
Prince Alexander. The King (it is believed) went so far as to say that no other
marriage should ever take place, and that the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and his son should never put
foot in the country; they should not be allowed to land, and must go back whence they came.</p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: -0.5em;">The Prince of Orange had himself been a candidate for the hand of Princess Charlotte,
and had no reason to be friendly to King Leopold, of whom it is recorded that he
said, "Voil&agrave; un homme qui a pris ma femme et mon royaume."</p>

his daughter<sup>5</sup>; I admired also that for your Aunt. They do
your spirit of invention honour, and it is a very good plan to
draw subjects from books or plays which interest you. You
will feel the loss of a pleasant society in the old Palace, the
more so as your relations are good unsophisticated people, a
thing which one does not so often meet with. I suppose that
part of your London amusements will soon be over. You
were going to Windsor, which you will probably have left by
this time. I hope you were very prudent; I cannot disguise
from you, that though the inhabitants are good-natured

people, still that I think you want all your natural caution
with them. Never permit yourself to be induced to tell them
any opinion or sentiment of yours which is <i>beyond the sphere of
common conversation</i> and its ordinary topics. Bad use would
be made of it against yourself, and you cannot in that subject
be too much guarded. I know well the people we have to deal
with. I am extremely impartial, but I shall also always be
equally watchful.... God bless you! Ever, my dear child,

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Laeken</span>, <i>18th November 1836</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">... Poor Charles X. is dead, it is said of the cholera. I
regret him; few people were ever kinder to me than the good
old man. He was blinded by certain absolute ideas, but a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.53" id="pagei.53"></a>[page&nbsp;53]</span>
good man, and deserving to be loved. History will state that
Louis XVIII. was a most liberal monarch, reigning with great
mildness and justice to his end, but that his brother, from his
despotic and harsh disposition, upset all the other had done,
and lost the throne. Louis XVIII. was a clever, hard-hearted
man, shackled by no principle, very proud and false. Charles X.
an honest man, a kind friend, an honourable master, sincere in
his opinions, and inclined to do everything that is right. That
teaches us what we ought to believe in history as it is compiled
according to ostensible events and results known to the generality
of people. Memoirs are much more instructive, if written
honestly and not purposely fabricated, as it happens too often
nowadays, particularly at Paris.... I shall not fail to read
the books you so kindly recommend. I join you a small copy
of our very liberal Constitution, hitherto conscientiously
executed&mdash;no easy matter. You may communicate it to your
Mother; it is the best answer to an infamous Radical or Tory-Radical
paper, the <i>Constitutional</i>, which seems determined to
run down the Coburg family. I don't understand the meaning
of it; the only happiness poor Charlotte knew was during her
short wedded existence, and there was but one voice on that
subject, that we offered a bright prospect to the nation. Since
that period I have (though been abused, and vilified merely
for drawing an income which was the consequence of a Treaty
ratified by both Houses of Parliament, and that without one
dissenting voice, a thing not very likely to happen again) done
everything to see England prosperous and powerful. I have
spared her, in 1831, much trouble and expense, as <i>without my
coming here very serious complications, war and all the expensive
operations connected with it</i>, must have taken place. I give the
whole of my income, without the reservation of a farthing, to
the country; I preserve unity on the Continent, have frequently
prevented mischief at Paris, and to thank me for all
that, I get the most scurrilous abuse, in which the good people
from <i>constant practice so much excel</i>.... The conclusion of all
this&mdash;and that by people whose very existence in political life
may be but of a few years' standing&mdash;is scurrilous abuse of the
Coburg family. I should like to know what harm the Coburg
family has done to England? But enough of this. Your
principle is very good; one must not mind what newspapers
say. Their power is a fiction of the worst description, and
their efforts marked by the worst faith and the greatest untruths.
If all the Editors of the papers in the countries where
the liberty of the press exists were to be assembled, we should
have a <i>crew</i> to which you would <i>not</i> confide a dog that you
would value, still less your honour and reputation....</p>

of admiration for you, than I have. Independent of all that
you have done&mdash;which I never, never can be grateful enough

innate in me, for from my earliest years the name of <i>Uncle</i> was

you!</p>

<p class="ind">Your letter is so interesting and instructive that I could

<p class="ind">I cannot tell you how distressed I was by the late unfortunate
<i>contre-r&eacute;volution manqu&eacute;e</i> at Lisbon,<sup>15</sup> and how sorry I was to
see by the letter you wrote me, that you were still unaware of
it on the 18th. Mamma received a letter from Lord Palmerston
yesterday morning, which she has sent you, and which is consolatory,
I think. He speaks in the highest terms of our
beloved Ferdinand, which proves that he becomes daily more
and more worthy of his arduous situation, and says that the
Queen's situation "is better than it was," less bad than it
might have been "after such an affair," and not so good as it
would have been had poor Donna Maria waited patiently till
all was ripe for action. Dietz<sup>16</sup> wrote Mamma a most desponding
letter, so much so, that had we not got Lord Palmerston's
letter we must have thought all, all was over.<sup>17</sup> I hope, dear

consented.
On its being told me, I said nothing, though I felt
grieved beyond measure at the thought of any change. Not
long after this, Lord Grey, and also the Archbishop of Canterbury,
acquainted Mamma that the country, having been
accustomed to hear me called Victoria, had become used to it,
<i>enfin</i>, <i>liked it</i>, and therefore, to my great delight, the idea of a
change was given up.<sup>18</sup></p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 15: Prince Ferdinand was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the
Portuguese army on the advice of the Duc de Terceira, then Prime Minister. The appointment was highly
unpopular; riots broke out, the army mutinied, and rose against the authorities, with the
result that the Queen of Portugal was compelled to accept the Radical
Constitution of 1820, in the place of Dom Pedro's constitutional Charter of 1826. Later in the
year the Queen, assisted by Palmella, Terceira, and Saldanha, made a counter-move,
believing that the people of Lisbon would support her, and proposed to dismiss her
Ministers; she had, however, been misled as to the popular aid forthcoming, and had to give up
the struggle, S&aacute; da Bandeira becoming Prime Minister. The Queen, virtually a
captive, had to accede to the revolutionary requirements.</p>

him to Portugal on his marriage with Donna Maria, and took a considerable part in political affairs.</p>

Guards, who threatened to march on Belem, where the Queen was; she had to apply to the British Marines

proposition to add &pound;10,000 a year to the Duchess of Kent's income, Sir M. W. Ridley suggested
changing the Princess's name to Elizabeth, as being "more accordant to the feelings of the
people," saying that he had heard the subject "frequently and seriously argued." Hunt,
the Radical, who opposed the grant, saw no objection to the change, and Lord Althorp
thought the matter of no particular consequence. The Princess's own feelings,
and those of her mother, do not seem to have been considered. See <i>Hansard</i>, 3rd

<h3  style="margin-top: 5em;">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>

<h3 style="margin-top: -0.5em;">TO CHAPTER VI</h3>


<p>The closing months of the reign of William IV. were not marked
by any stirring events at home. The Conservative opposition to the
Melbourne Ministry was strengthened before the meeting of Parliament
by a great speech by Sir Robert Peel at Glasgow, and Lord
Brougham later on emerged from his retirement to become the able
and venomous critic of his former friends. The Government failed
to carry important measures on Church Rates and Irish Municipal
Corporations, while the Radical group pressed persistently their
favourite motions in support of the Ballot, and against the Property
qualification of members, Primogeniture, the Septennial Act, the
Bishops' seats and Proxy Voting in the House of Lords. The
Ministry was saved from shipwreck by the demise of the Crown and
by the accession of the Princess Victoria, who, on attaining her legal
majority a month earlier, had received marked signs of enthusiastic
popular favour.</p>

<p>The General Election in the Autumn did not materially affect the
position of parties, the Radicals losing and O'Connell gaining seats;
but the prestige of Lord Melbourne was increased by the unique
position he now held in reference to the Sovereign. Parliament was
opened in person by the Queen on 20th November, and the Civil List
dealt with, the amount allocated being &pound;385,000 as against &pound;510,000
in the late reign (of which &pound;75,000, formerly paid in pensions, was
now struck off, and other arrangements made).</p>

<p>For some time past the state of Canada had caused grave anxiety.
By an Act of 1791, it had been divided into Upper and Lower Canada,
each with a Governor, Council, and House of Representatives, Lower
Canada being in the main French, while Upper Canada was occupied
by British settlers. Friction first arose in the former, between the
nominee Council and the popular Assembly, the Assembly declining
to pay the salaries of officials whom they had censured, but whom
the Executive had retained in their posts. Mr Papineau, who had
been Speaker of the Assembly, was leader in the popular movement.
Lord Gosford, the Governor of Lower Canada, dismissed some Militia
officers who had taken part in political demonstrations, and warrants
were issued for the apprehension of certain members of the Assembly,
on the charge of high treason: within a short time the discontented
party broke out into rebellion. The course which events would take
in Upper Canada was for a time doubtful. Sir Francis Head, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.57" id="pagei.57"></a>[page&nbsp;57]</span>
Governor, placed his regular troops at the service of Lord Gosford,
preferring to rely on the militia. This unusual action was successful,
but was not approved by the Colonial Office. The state of affairs
became very alarming at the close of the year, when it was announced
in Parliament that Lord Gosford had resigned and that Sir John Colborne
(afterwards Lord Seaton) had been appointed to succeed him.</p>

<p>In France the confederates of Louis Napoleon in the Strasburg
outbreak were tried and acquitted; a treaty was concluded at Tafna
with Abd-el-Kader, but negotiations for a similar agreement with
Achmet Bey were less successful, and operations were continued
against Constantin with successful results, the town being carried
by an assault on 13th October, with some loss of officers and men
on the French side.</p>

<p>Affairs continued unsettled in the Peninsula. In Spain General
Evans was defeated near San Sebastian, but afterwards, in conjunction
with Lord John Hay, captured Irun, the frontier town. Don
Carlos meanwhile marched on Madrid, but was encountered by
Espartero, Commander-in-Chief of the Christinos, who was Prime
Minister for a brief period during the year. The British legion was
dissolved, and Evans returned to England.</p>

<p>In Portugal the English were becoming unpopular for their
supposed intervention: Ferdinand, the Queen's consort, who was
naturally believed to be in harmony with the British Cabinet, acted
tactlessly in accepting the Commandership-in-Chief, and internal
hostilities continued throughout the year.</p>

<p>In Hanover a reactionary step was taken by King Ernest, who
had succeeded his brother, William IV. of England, on the throne
of Hanover; by letters patent he abrogated the Constitution of
1833, an action which, imperfect and open to criticism though the
Constitution was, naturally aroused anxiety among the supporters
of representative institutions throughout Europe.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Uncle</span>,&mdash; ... We saw Van de Weyer<sup>1</sup> on
Tuesday, and his conversation was most interesting. He
praises our dear Ferdinand most exceedingly, but as for the
poor Queen, what he told us does not redound much to her
credit; one good quality, however, she has, which is her
excessive fondness for and real <i>obedience</i> to Ferdinand. She
is unfortunately surrounded by a <i>camarilla</i><sup>2</sup> who poison her
ears, and fetter all her actions; poor soul! she is <i>much</i> to be
pitied. About Lavradio<sup>3</sup> you will also have, I fear, heard but
too much. Honesty and single-heartedness seems to have left
Portugal. Van de Weyer is so clear in all that he says, so
sensible, so quiet, so clever, and, last but not least, so agreeable;
I hope we shall soon see him again. You see, dear Uncle, how
much interest I take in Portugal; but I must say that I think
every one who knows dear Ferdinand, and particularly who
loves him as I do, must feel a very deep interest as to the fate
of the unhappy country in which he is destined to play so
prominent and difficult a part.</p>

<p class="ind">I have been reading to-day a very clever speech of Sir Robert
Peel's (not a political one) to the University at Glasgow, on
the occasion of his being elected Lord Rector of that college.
There is another speech of his at the dinner at Glasgow which
<i>is political</i>, but which I have not yet read....<sup>4</sup></p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 1: Sylvain Van de Weyer (b. 1802) was, in 1830, Belgian
Plenipotentiary at the Conference of London. He returned to his own country and became Foreign Minister. His
exertions contributed greatly to render successful the candidature of Prince Leopold for
the throne of Belgium. The King appointed him Belgian Minister in London, to which
post he returned in 1851, and held it till 1867. He was treated by the Queen
until his death in 1874 as a very intimate friend and adviser.</p>

January, and delivered an address on the principles of Education: strong political feeling was manifested,
groans being given for Lord Melbourne and the Ministry. At a civic banquet given in Sir

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Uncle</span>,&mdash; ... The affairs of the Peninsula are
indeed very distressing,<sup>5</sup> and what you tell me in your letter of
the 20th, as also in the former one, is highly interesting and,
alas! but too true. I trust, not withstanding what you say,
I may yet live to see Spain and Portugal settled. But I greatly
fear that the time is far distant.</p>

<p class="ind">Do you know Mendizabal?<sup>6</sup> I saw him at our house in
1835. Alava<sup>7</sup> presented him to us; he is a tall, dark, fine, and
clever-looking man. I remember his being so much struck
with my likeness to Donna Maria, which I was not aware was
the case. Pray, dear Uncle, may I ask you a silly question?&mdash;is
not the Queen of Spain<sup>8</sup> rather clever? You know her, and
what do you think of her? And do you know what sort of
people are about poor little Queen Isabel?<sup>9</sup> Poor, good Donna
Maria! I feel much for her; her education was one of the
worst that could be. As long as those Ficalhos and Melos
remain about her, nothing can be done. Could they not be got
rid of in time?</p>

<p class="ind">I was sorry to see that the French Chambers were rather
stormy.<sup>10</sup></p>

<p class="ind">I thank you much for the list of the ball of the 18th, which
must have been very splendid. The last ball <i>I</i> was at was our
own, and I concluded that very ball at half-past three in the
morning with a country dance, Albert being my partner.</p>

<p class="ind">Pray, dear Uncle, tell both young gentlemen, with my kindest
love, that I <i>often</i> think of that night and of many other pleasant
evenings we passed together. The singing will come all in time.
Who is their singing-master? I wish they had my worthy
Lablache. I sing regularly every evening, as I think it better
to do so every day to keep the voice manageable. Oh, my
beloved Uncle, could you join us, how delightful that would
be! How I should delight in singing with you all our favourite
things from <i>La Gazza</i>, <i>Otello</i>, <i>Il Barbiere</i>, etc., etc.</p>

him and play with him! Pray, dear Uncle, does he know such
a thing as that he has got an Aunt and Cousin on the other side
of the water? ...</p>

I wish you would, and give me your opinion of them.</p>

in time, things will come right. The Portuguese are, as you
say, a most inconceivable set of selfish politicians.</p>

<p class="ind">Our friend, Mr Hume,<sup>12</sup> made a most violent speech at a
dinner given to him and old George Byng<sup>13</sup> at Drury Lane last
week.<sup>14</sup> He called Sir R. Peel and some other Tories "the
cloven foot," which I think rather strong. I think that <i>great</i>
violence and striving such a pity, on both sides, don't you, dear
Uncle? They irritate one another so uselessly by calling one
another fools, blockheads, liars, and so forth for no purpose.
I think violence so bad in everything. They should imitate
you, and be calm, for you have had, God knows! enough cause
for irritation from your <i>worthy</i> Dutch neighbours and others.
You will, I fear, laugh at my <i>politics</i>, but I like telling <i>you</i> my
feelings, for you alone can put me right on such subjects.</p>

Strafford in 1817.</p>

<p class="footnote1">Footnote 14: This was a dinner given by the Middlesex reformers to their
representatives. Grote also spoke and said that the Tories well knew that their dominion rested upon
everything that was antiquated and corrupt and anti-popular in the nation&mdash;upon
oligarchical predominance in the State, and sectarian pride and privileges in the Church.</p>

<span class="rightnote">POLITICAL PASSION</span>

<p class="indright"><i>3rd February 1837</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dear Child</span>,&mdash; ... I am sorry to see so much violence
in England at this moment; I consider it as the most lamentable
circumstance, as it renders matters so very difficult to
settle. Besides, the poor Crown is more or less the loser in all
this, as it generally ends with the abolition of something or
other which might have proved useful for the carrying on of
Government. A rule which you may thus early impress on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.61" id="pagei.61"></a>[page&nbsp;61]</span>
your mind is, that people are far from acting generally according
to the dictates of their interests, but oftener in consequence
of their passions, though it may even prove injurious to their
interests. If the Tory part of Parliament could have brought
themselves to act without passion, much in the reform of
Parliament might have been settled much more in conformity
with their best interests. I was authorised, in 1831, to speak
in this sense to the Duke of Wellington by Lord Grey;<sup>15</sup> the
effect would have been highly beneficial to both parties, but
passion made it impossible to succeed. This is a dangerous
part of the business, and we must see during the present session
of Parliament if parties are grown wiser. I fear they are not.
The business of the highest in a State is certainly, in my
opinion, to act with great impartiality and a spirit of justice
for the good of all, and not of this or that party.<sup>16</sup></p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 15: This refers to the rejection of the Reform Bill by the House of
Lords in 1831; as a consequence, mobs broke the windows of Apsley House, and fired Nottingham Castle.</p>

<p class="footnote1">Footnote 16: On 14th April 1837, Sir Robert Peel wrote to J. W. Croker:&mdash; ...
"We are, in short, in this state of things. All the convictions and inclinations of the
Government are with their Conservative opponents. Half their actions and all their speeches
are with the Radicals." (<i>Croker Papers</i>, ii. 306.)</p>

when we leave this place, but I should think to-day week. You
must be pleased, dear Uncle, I think, for we shall have been <i>six

had received since his return, that all had gone off quietly, that
Ferdinand was daily gaining popularity, and that both he and
the Queen had been very well received at the theatre. The
man who threw a stone at Ferdinand was a Frenchman, whom,
it seems, Ferdinand had relieved with money over and over
again. A fine specimen of gratitude!</p>

<p class="ind">... We had a dinner on Saturday which amused me, as I
am very fond of <i>pleasant</i> society, and we have been for these last
three weeks immured within our old palace, and I longed sadly
for some gaiety. After being so very long in the country I was
preparing to go out in right earnest, whereas I have only been
<i>twice</i> to the play since our return, which is marvellous! However,
we are to have another dinner to-morrow, and are going
to the play and Opera. After Easter I trust I shall make
ample amends for all this solitariness. I hope to begin singing
with Lablache shortly after Easter. But to return to last
Saturday's dinner. We had the Archbishop of Dublin,<sup>18</sup> a
clever but singular man, and his lady; Lord Palmerston, with
whom I had much pleasant and amusing conversation after
dinner&mdash;you know how agreeable he is; then Lady Cadogan,<sup>19</sup>
who enquired much after you and Aunt Louise; Lord and Lady
Rosebery,<sup>20</sup> Mr and Mrs E. Stanley,<sup>21</sup> Lord Morpeth,<sup>22</sup> Lord
Templetown,<sup>23</sup> Sir John Cam Hobhouse,<sup>24</sup> Dr Lushington,<sup>25</sup> and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.63" id="pagei.63"></a>[page&nbsp;63]</span>
Catholic and a very clever man. Lady Cadogan, who is not
long come back from Paris, says that the Duke of Orleans has
been going out very little and is remarkably well. I saw a
report in the papers that he and the Duc de Nemours were
coming over here, which I fear is not true; I wish it was....</p>

dearest Uncle, you ought not to regret it, though there is not a
doubt that <i>Greece</i> would be much happier were you there. But
I have heard from various people who have been staying in
Greece that they very soon got to like the Turks much better
than the Greeks, who are very untrue, and are quite banditti-like;
then, again, the country, though undoubtedly fine in
parts, is a rocky and barren country, and also you are constantly
exposed to the effects of the Plague, that most dreadful
of all evils; and then, lastly, how very, very far you would be,
how cut off from all those who are dear to you, and how exposed

the greatest pleasure. I was sure from your constant affection
for us that you would feel much interested in the event of the
24th. It was a moment of some anxiety, but all passed over
very well. Your Aunt is going on very well, and the little
cousin<sup>28</sup> also. He is smaller than his brother was, but promises
to be like him; the features are much the same, the shape of
the forehead and mouth. The elder Prince was much interested
about his <i>fr&egrave;re</i>, and anxious to see him; at first, however, he
declared after a long contemplation, "<i>pas beau fr&egrave;re!</i>" Now
he thinks better of him, but makes a very odd little face when
he sees him. The name of the little one will be Philippe Eug&egrave;ne
Ferdinand Marie Cl&eacute;ment Baudouin (Baldwin)&mdash;a name of the
old Counts of Flanders&mdash;L&eacute;opold Georges. My Aunt, who is
his godmother, wished he should be called Philippe in honour

<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.65" id="pagei.65"></a>[page&nbsp;65]</span>
go out without your Mother&mdash;you would require. On the
other hand, it may become matter of examination if you will
perhaps like to have some young ladies attendants in the style
of Lady Catherine Jenkinson;<sup>32</sup> should this be your wish, it
would become necessary to make very good choices, else perhaps
you would derive more trouble than comfort from the
arrangement; <i>cela va sans dire</i>, that the choice could only be
made by yourself, and that nobody should be given you <i>against</i>
your wishes. Should the King speak to you on the subject, I
would at once express this my wish if you should approve some
such arrangement, and beg him to let <i>you choose</i>. Resist mildly
but <i>positively</i> any nomination of a Gentleman other than the
Dean; it is highly probable that any other would be put about
you as a spy, and turn out at all events a great bore, which is
better avoided....</p>

<p class="indright"><i>28th April 1837</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My most beloved Uncle</span>,&mdash;.... Sir Henry Hardinge's<sup>35</sup>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.66" id="pagei.66"></a>[page&nbsp;66]</span>
motion was quite lost, I am happy to say, and don't you think,
dearest Uncle, that it has almost done good, as it proves that
the Tories have lost all chance of getting in? It was a trial of
strength, and the Ministry have triumphed. I have been
reading in the papers, what I suppose you already know, that
it is believed that the Lords <i>will</i> pass the Irish Corporation
Bill;<sup>36</sup> and also that Ministers mean to drop for the present the
question about Church Rates,<sup>37</sup> as the Radicals, being angry
with Ministers relative to the Canada business, would not support
them well.</p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 35: On a motion for going into supply, Sir H. Hardinge proposed an
amendment censuring the Government for the authorisation of the raising of a force of Volunteers to
assist the Spanish Government, and for the method in which that force had been organised.
The amendment was lost by a majority of 36, on 19th April.</p>

<p class="footnote1">Footnote 36: The Irish Municipal Bill, to convert Corporations of
Municipalities into Electoral Councils, was introduced in the House of Commons on the 15th of February. The
Bill was opposed by the Conservatives, but passed the House of Commons. In the Lords
an amendment of Lyndhurst's struck out the constructive clauses, and the Act
became, on the 18th of May, an Act for the Abolition of Municipalities in Ireland. Lord
John Russell brought forward a motion to reconstruct the Bill. But the Peers declined to pass
it, and it was postponed.</p>

<p class="footnote1">Footnote 37: As Ministers only obtained a majority of 5 in a house of 569, the
measure was dropped.</p>

<p class="ind">... I hope you occupy yourself with the several great
questions which agitate parties. I think a good mode will be
to talk concerning them sometimes with the Dean. He is a
good moderate man, and still well able to give you sufficient
information. From conversation with clever people, such as
dine sometimes with you, much may be very usefully gathered,
and you will do well to attend to this. I am no enemy to this

<p class="ind">... You may depend upon it that I shall profit by your
excellent advice respecting Politics. Pray, dear Uncle, have
you read Lord Palmerston's speech concerning the Spanish
affairs,<sup>38</sup> which he delivered the night of the division on Sir
Henry Hardinge's motion? It is much admired. The Irish
Tithes question came on last night in the House of Commons,<sup>39</sup>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.67" id="pagei.67"></a>[page&nbsp;67]</span>
and I am very anxious for the morning papers, to see what has
been done. Lord Melbourne looks remarkably well, Lord
Palmerston not very well, and as for poor little Lord John
Russell, he is only a shadow of himself. It must be dreadfully
fagging work for them; they sit so very late too, for when the
Spanish question came on, the division only took place at four
o'clock in the morning, and I saw them at the Drawing-Room
the same day afterwards....</p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 38: Lord Palmerston indignantly asked whether England should continue
to fulfil her nengagement with the Queen of Spain, or disgracefully abandon an ally whom she
had pledged herself to succour.</p>

<p class="footnote1">Footnote 39: The Irish Tithe Bill, a measure to facilitate the collection of
tithes, was abandoned because the Tories would not consent to any secular appropriation of Church
revenues, and the Whigs would not consent to the withdrawal of their amendments. A
remarkable feature in the Bill was a proposal that a portion of every clergyman's income
should be applied to education, as was already prescribed by a former Act.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Laeken</span>, <i>25th May 1837</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Child</span>,&mdash;You have had some battles and
difficulties of which I am completely in the dark. The thing I
am most curious to learn is what the King proposed to you concerning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.68" id="pagei.68"></a>[page&nbsp;68]</span>
your establishment.... I shall reserve my opinion till
I am better informed, but by what I heard I did not approve of
it, because I thought it ill-timed. Stockmar will be able to do
much. Two things seem necessary; not to be fettered by any
establishment other than what will be <i>comfortable to you</i>, and
then to avoid any breach with your mother. I have fully
instructed Stockmar, and I must say he left me in such good
disposition that I think he will be able to be of great use to you.
The great thing is to act without precipitation and with caution.
The King seems better again. I am very curious to
know what he proposed; you will have it in your power to
modify his proposition, as it is difficult your <i>approbation</i> should
be dispensed with; it would be a great fault in your situation
to <i>submit</i> to this.... They seemed to think the King dying,
which does not appear to be the case. Be steady, my good
child, and <i>not</i> put out by <i>anything</i>; as long as I live <i>you will
not want a faithful friend and supporter</i>....</p>

<p class="ind">Here your somewhat curious little soul has at least the outlines
of things....</p>

<p class="ind"><i>26th.</i>&mdash;I received yesterday the whole of the papers concerning
the King's propositions.<sup>42</sup> I approve your letter to the
King, as it is amiable and generous, and this in your position will
always tell favourably. I think that if <i>he</i> is well advised he will
chiefly consult <i>your wishes</i>. This is the footing on which you
must place matters. It is not worth while to be told that one
is in some sort of age when the consequence is that you are not
consulted in what concerns you most personally. Avoid in
future to say much about your great <i>youth</i> and <i>inexperience</i>.
Who made the letter? Was it yourself, or came it from your
Mother? You have now the Baron at your elbow, and even
your Mother was most anxious for his arrival. <i>Speak sometimes
with him</i>; it is necessary to accustom you to the thing.</p>

<p class="ind">About the King's health.<sup>43</sup> I am doubtful what to think. We
have foreseen the case and treated it formerly. The great
thing would be to make no change, to keep Ministers and everything
as it is, and to gain time; in this way <i>no one is hurt and
no amour-propre bless&eacute;</i>. For this reason I lean to your keeping,
to begin with, Sir Herbert Taylor<sup>44</sup> for your <i>official</i> secretary,
though I am not quite <i>decided</i> on the subject. He knows the
manner in which the <i>daily business</i> is carried on; this is important.
I believe him, and have found him to be an honest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.69" id="pagei.69"></a>[page&nbsp;69]</span>
man, that would do for State matters; it would not be required
that he should be your <i>confidential</i> adviser. Now I conclude,
and send you this letter through Stockmar. My best regards
to Lehzen. Ever your faithful Uncle and Friend,</p>

<p class="indright"><i>26th May 1837</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">... The demonstrations of affection and kindness from all
sides towards me on my birthday, were most gratifying. The
parks and streets were crowded all day as though something
very extraordinary had happened. Yesterday I received
twenty-two Addresses from various places, all very pretty and
loyal; one in particular was very well written which was presented
by Mr. Attwood<sup>45</sup> from the Political Union at Birmingham.</p>

<p class="ind">I am delighted to hear Stockmar is at length arrived; he
reached London on Wednesday, and we shall see him to-day.</p>

<p class="ind">How distressed I am that poor dear Ernest<sup>46</sup> has been so ill!
Thank God! that he is now better.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Tuileries</span>, <i>7th June 1837</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">... The <i>entr&eacute;e</i><sup>48</sup> last Sunday was something remarkably
splendid; we saw it from the Tuileries, as we had nothing to
do with the business itself, and your Aunt's rank would have
clashed with that of the Duchess of Orleans. The effect of all
this on the people of this great town has been <i>very great</i>, and
evidently much ground has been solidly regained. The King,
getting out of that sort of confinement in which it was necessary
to keep, has gained much in personal comfort, and also in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.70" id="pagei.70"></a>[page&nbsp;70]</span>
political point of view; because to have a King who cannot
show himself without being shot at, is a state of society which
lowers his authority....</p>

<p class="ind">For the present the best plan is to continue to act as you have
done hitherto; to avoid quarrels, but also to stick <i>firmly to
your resolution when once</i> taken. The violence which is sometimes
shown is so well known to you, you know also so well that
you have nothing to fear from these people, that <i>you must keep
up your usual cool spirit</i>, whatever may be tried in the House to
<i>teaze you out of it</i>. I mean to wait some more detailed accounts
of what is going on in England before I give my opinion on what
ought to be done in the case that the King's disease should take
a more fatal turn.</p>

<p class="ind">As I told you before, however, when we treated this subject
verbally and in writing, I believe it to be your interest to act
very mildly, <i>to begin by taking everything as the King leaves it</i>.
By this system you avoid disappointing those whose hopes may
remain unchanged, as your own choices, as it were, are not yet
made. Parties, which at present are so nearly balanced, remain
<i>in statu quo</i>, and you gain time.</p>

<p class="ind">I must conclude now this letter. My winding up is, keep
your mind <i>cool</i> and <i>easy</i>; be <i>not alarmed</i> at the prospect of
becoming perhaps sooner than you expected Queen; aid will
not be wanting, and the great thing is that you should have
some honest people about you who have your welfare <i>really at
heart</i>. Stockmar will be in this respect all we can wish, and we
must hope that <i>useful</i> occupation will prevent his health from
suffering. Now once more God bless you. Ever, my dear
child, your faithful Uncle and Friend,</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Laeken</span>, <i>15th June 1837</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My beloved Child</span>,&mdash;I hope that to-day will not pass over
without bringing me a letter from you. In the meantime I will
begin this epistle, which will go by a messenger of my own to-morrow.
In every letter I shall write to you I mean to repeat
to you, as a <i>fundamental rule</i>, <i>to be courageous, firm and honest,
as you have been till now</i>. You may count upon my faithful
good offices in all difficulties, and you have at your command
Stockmar, whose <i>judgment</i>, <i>heart</i>, and <i>character</i> offer all
the
guarantees we can wish for. I wish nothing but to see you
<i>happy and prosperous</i>, and by Sunday I shall probably write
you a long letter, which will enter into details about most
things.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.71" id="pagei.71"></a>[page&nbsp;71]</span>

<p class="ind" style="margin-bottom: 5em;">My object is that you should be no one's <i>tool</i>, and though
young, and naturally not yet experienced, your good natural
sense and the <i>truth</i> of your character will, with faithful and
proper advice, get you very well through the difficulties of your
future position, should it be the will of Providence to take the
King from this earthly life. Of his real position I am still not
quite able to judge, there being so much contradictory in the
reports. Be this as it may, the great thing for you is, not to
be hurried into important measures, and to <i>gain time</i>. A new
reign is always a time of hope; everybody is disposed to see
something for his own wishes and prospects. The policy of a
new Sovereign must therefore be to act in such a manner as to
hurt as little as possible the <i>amour-propre</i> of people, to let
circumstances and the force of things bring about the disappointments
which no human power could prevent coming sooner or
later: that they should come as <i>late</i> as possible is in your
interest. Should anything happen to the King before I can
enter more fully into the necessary details, limit yourself to
<i>taking kindly</i> and in a <i>friendly</i> manner the present Administration
into your service. They are <i>naturally friendly to your
interests</i>, <i>as you are in fact the only possible Sovereign of the whole
family</i>, with the exception of the Duke of Sussex, they can
<i>serve</i> with <i>sincerity</i> and <i>attachment</i>. This is of great
importance to you, as it is by no means the same thing to have people who
aid and assist you with feelings of real attachment, or merely
from cold and calculating motives of political expediency and
self-interest. This being done, no other step should be taken
without consulting seriously. The very time which is necessary
to attain this end is favourable to you, as it is your greatest
interest for the <i>present moment</i> to act most cautiously and to
gain as much <i>time</i> as possible. In high positions it is excessively
difficult to <i>retrace</i> a false move to get out of a mistake; and
there exists very rarely, except in time of war and civil feuds, a
necessity for an <i>immediate</i> decision. Your part must be, to
resume once more what I said before, to remain as long as
possible <i>agreeable</i> to all parties, and after the formation of the
Ministry, to be most careful how you take any measure of
importance....</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My beloved Uncle</span>,&mdash;... I cannot say how happy I am that

dear King was so well received; I trust he will now at last be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.72" id="pagei.72"></a>[page&nbsp;72]</span>
rewarded for all the troubles and anxiety he has had ever since
1830. Lord Palmerston said that the French say that <i>l'assassinat
est hors de mode</i>. I hope and trust in Heaven that this
may be the case, and <i>for ever</i>!</p>

<p class="ind">You know, of course, dear Uncle, how <i>very ill</i> the King is;

Consequently, we have not been out anywhere in public since

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Laeken</span>, <i>17th June 1837</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My beloved Child</span>,&mdash;... I shall to-day enter on the subject
of what is to be done when the King ceases to live. The
moment you get official communication of it, you will entrust
Lord Melbourne with the office of retaining the present Administration
as your Ministers. You will do this in that honest and
kind way which is quite your own, and say some kind things on
the subject. The fact is that the present Ministers are those
who will serve you personally with the greatest <i>sincerity</i> and, I
trust, attachment. For them, as well as for the Liberals at
large, you are the <i>only</i> Sovereign that offers them <i>des chances
d'existence et de dur&eacute;e</i>. With the exception of the Duke of
Sussex, there is no <i>one</i> in the family that offers them anything
like what they can reasonably hope from you, and your immediate
successor, with the mustaches,<sup>49</sup> is enough to frighten them
into the most violent attachment for you.</p>

<p class="ind">... The irksome position in which you have lived will have
the merit to have given you the habit of <i>discretion</i> and <i>prudence</i>,
as in your position you never can have <i>too much</i> of either.
Great measures of State I hope you will be able to avoid at first.
I have already&mdash;if you would read it over, and perhaps let
Stockmar see it&mdash;written to you some months ago on the subject
of the necessity of maintaining the influence of conservative
principles, and of protecting the Church. You will do well to
keep both objects in view. You will do wisely by showing
yourself attached to the English Protestant Church as it exists
in the State; you are particularly where you are, because you
are a Protestant. I know you are averse to persecution, and
you are right; miss, however, <i>no opportunity</i> to show your
sincere feeling for the existing Church; it is <i>right</i> and <i>meet</i> that
you should do so. I must repeat that you will do well as long
as it will be possible to hurt no one's hopes or prospects. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.73" id="pagei.73"></a>[page&nbsp;73]</span>
this will not always, or very long, be possible is the consequence
of the state of parties; still, one may be frank and honest, and
still kind to all. Concerning foreign policy I shall write on
some future occasion. In the meantime I trust you will protect
the two Queens in the Peninsula, who are miserably ill off.
I am sure, with your good sense you will not find it difficult to
judge questions yourself. I cannot too much recommend this,
as it will then become a habit, and even an amusement to you.
Cultivate always a genuine feeling of right and wrong, and be
very true and honourable in your dealings; this gives great
strength. I have taken into consideration the advantage or
disadvantage of my coming over to you <i>immediately</i>. The
result of my <i>examen</i> is that I think it better to visit you later.
If, however, you wanted me at any time, I should come in a
moment. People might fancy I came to enslave you, while I
glory in the contrary; and, thirdly, that they might be jealous,
or <i>affect</i> it at least, of my coming, as if I thought of ruling the
realm for <i>purposes of my own</i>....</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearly beloved Uncle</span>,&mdash;Your <i>kind</i> and <i>dear</i> letter,
containing <i>most wholesome</i>, <i>prudent</i>, <i>sound</i> and
<i>excellent</i> advice,
was given me by our <i>good</i> and <i>invaluable honest</i> friend, Stockmar,
and I beg you to accept my best thanks for it. Before I
say anything else, let me tell you how happy and thankful I am
to have Stockmar here; he has <i>been</i>, and <i>is</i>, of the <i>greatest</i>
possible use, and be assured, dearest Uncle, that he possesses
my <i>most entire confidence</i>!</p>

<p class="ind">The King's state, I may fairly say, is <i>hopeless</i>; he may
<i>perhaps</i> linger a few days, but he cannot recover <i>ultimately</i>.
Yesterday the physicians declared he could not live till the
morning, but to-day he is a little better; the great fear is his
<i>excessive</i> weakness and no <i>pulse</i> at all. Poor old man! I feel
sorry for him; he was always personally kind to me, and I
should be ungrateful and devoid of feeling if I did not remember
this.</p>

<p class="ind">I look forward to the event which it seems is likely to occur
soon, with calmness and quietness; I am not alarmed at it, and
yet I do not suppose myself quite equal to all; I trust, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.74" id="pagei.74"></a>[page&nbsp;74]</span>
that with <i>good-will</i>, <i>honesty</i>, and <i>courage</i> I shall not, at
all events,
<i>fail</i>. Your advice is most excellent, and you may depend upon
it I shall make use of it, and follow it, as also what Stockmar
says. I <i>never showed</i> myself, <i>openly</i>, to belong to <i>any
party</i>,
and I <i>do not</i> belong to any party. The Administration will
undoubtedly be well received by me, the more so as I have <i>real</i>
confidence in them, and in particular in Lord Melbourne, who is
a straightforward, honest, clever and good man.</p>

<p class="ind">I need not add much more, dearest Uncle, but that I trust
that the all-powerful Being who has so long watched over my
destinies will guide and support me, in whatever situation and
station it may please Him to place me!...</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE QUEEN'S JOURNAL</span>

<p class="indright"><i>Tuesday, 20th June 1837</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">I was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma, who told me that the
Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham were here, and
wished to see me. I got out of bed and went into my sitting-room
(only in my dressing-gown) and <i>alone</i>, and saw them.
Lord Conyngham (the Lord Chamberlain) then acquainted me
that my poor Uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired
at 12 minutes past 2 this morning, and consequently that I am
<i>Queen</i>. Lord Conyngham knelt down and kissed my hand, at
the same time delivering to me the official announcement of the
poor King's demise. The Archbishop then told me that the
Queen was desirous that he should come and tell me the details
of the last moments of my poor good Uncle; he said that he
had directed his mind to religion, and had died in a perfectly
happy, quiet state of mind, and was quite prepared for his
death. He added that the King's sufferings at the last were
not very great but that there was a good deal of uneasiness.
Lord Conyngham, whom I charged to express my feelings of
condolence and sorrow to the poor Queen, returned directly
to Windsor. I then went to my room and dressed.</p>

<p class="ind2">Since it has pleased Providence to place me in this station,
I shall do my utmost to fulfil my duty towards my country;
I am very young and perhaps in many, though not in all things,
inexperienced, but I am sure that very few have more real goodwill
and more real desire to do what is fit and right than I
have.</p>
<span class="rightnote">THE QUEEN'S FIRST COUNCIL</span>
<p class="ind2">Breakfasted, during which time good, faithful Stockmar
came and talked to me. Wrote a letter to dear Uncle Leopold
and a few words to dear good Feodore. Received a letter from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.76" id="pagei.76"></a>[page&nbsp;76]</span>
Lord Melbourne in which he said he would wait upon me at a
little before 9. At 9 came Lord Melbourne, whom I saw in my
room, and of <i>course quite alone</i>, as I shall <i>always</i> do all my
Ministers. He kissed my hand, and I then acquainted him
that it had long been my intention to retain him and the rest
of the present Ministry at the head of affairs, and that it could
not be in better hands than his. He again then kissed my
hand. He then read to me the Declaration which I was to
read to the Council, which he wrote himself, and which is a very
fine one. I then talked with him some little time longer, after
which he left me. He was in full dress. I like him very much,
and feel confidence in him. He is a very straightforward,
honest, clever and good man. I then wrote a letter to the
Queen. At about 11 Lord Melbourne came again to me,
and spoke to me upon various subjects. At about half-past
11 I went downstairs and held a Council in the red
saloon.</p>

<p class="ind2">I went in of course quite alone and remained seated the
whole time. My two Uncles, the Dukes of Cumberland and
Sussex, and Lord Melbourne conducted me. The Declaration,
the various forms, the swearing in of the Privy Councillors, of
which there were a great number present, and the reception of
some of the Lords of the Council, previous to the Council, in
an adjacent room (likewise alone) I subjoin here. I was <i>not</i>
at all nervous and had the satisfaction of hearing that people
were satisfied with what I had done and how I had done it.
Received after this, audiences of Lord Melbourne, Lord John
Russell, Lord Albemarle (Master of the Horse), and the Archbishop
of Canterbury, all in my room and alone. Saw Stockmar.
Saw Clark, whom I named my physician. Saw Mary.
Wrote to Uncle Ernest. Saw Ernest Hohenlohe, who brought
me a kind and very feeling letter from the poor Queen. I
feel very much for her, and really feel that the poor good
King was always so kind personally to me, that I should be
ungrateful were I not to recollect it and feel grieved at his
death. The poor Queen is wonderfully composed now, I
hear.</p>

<p class="ind2">Wrote my journal. Took my dinner upstairs alone. Went
downstairs. Saw Stockmar. At about twenty minutes to 9
came Lord Melbourne and remained till near 10. I had a very
important and a very <i>comfortable</i> conversation with him. Each
time I see him I feel more confidence in him; I find him very
kind in his manner too. Saw Stockmar. Went down and said
good-night to Mamma, etc. My <i>dear</i> Lehzen will <i>always</i>
remain with me as my friend, but will take no situation about
me, and I think she is right.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My beloved Child</span>,&mdash;Your new dignities will not change or
increase my old affection for you; may Heaven assist you, and
may I have the <i>happiness of being able to be of use to you</i>, and to
contribute to those successes in your new career for which I
am so anxious. Your letter of the 19th, written very shortly
before the important event took place, gave me <i>great satisfaction</i>;
it showed me a temper of mind well calculated for the
occasion. To see the difficulties of the task without shrinking
from them or feeling alarm, and to meet them with courage, is
the way to succeed. I have often seen that the <i>confidence</i> of
success has been the <i>cause of the success itself</i>, and you will do
well to <i>preserve</i> that sentiment.</p>

<p class="ind">I have been most happy to learn that the swearing in of the
Council passed so well. The Declaration in the newspapers I
find simple and appropriate. The translation in the papers
says, "<i>J'ai &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;lev&eacute;s en Angleterre.</i>" 1. I should advise to say
as often as possible that you are <i>born</i> in England. George III.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.79" id="pagei.79"></a>[page&nbsp;79]</span>
<i>gloried</i> in this, and as <i>none</i> of your cousins are born in England,
it is your interest <i>de faire reporter cela fortement</i>. 2. You never
can say too much in praise of your country and its inhabitants.
Two nations in Europe are really almost ridiculous in their own
exaggerated praises of themselves; these are the English and
the French. Your being very national is highly important, and
as you happen to be born in England and never to have left it
a moment,<sup>56</sup> it would be odd enough if people tried to make out
the contrary. 3. The Established Church I also recommend
strongly; you cannot, without <i>pledging</i> yourself to anything
<i>particular</i>, <i>say too much on the subject</i>. 4. Before you decide
on anything important I should be glad if you would consult
me; this would also have the advantage of giving you time.
In politics most measures will come in time within a certain
number of days; to retrace or back out of a measure is on the
contrary extremely <i>difficult</i>, and almost always <i>injurious</i> to the
highest authority.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My beloved Uncle</span>,&mdash;Though I have an <i>immense</i> deal of
<i>business</i> to do, I shall write you a few lines to thank you for
your kind and useful letter of the 23rd, which I have just received.
<i>Your</i> advice is always of the <i>greatest importance</i> to me.</p>

<p class="ind">Respecting Claremont, Stockmar will be able to explain to
you the <i>total</i> impossibility of my being out of London, as I must
see my Ministers <i>every</i> day. I am <i>very</i> well, sleep well, and
drive every evening in the country; it is so hot that walking
is out of the question. Before I go further let me pause to tell
you how fortunate I am to have at the head of the Government
a man like Lord Melbourne. I have seen him now every day,
with the exception of Friday, and the more I see him, the more
confidence I have in him; he is not only a clever statesman and
an honest man, but a good and a kind-hearted man, whose aim
is to do his duty for his country and not for a <i>party</i>. He is of
the greatest use to me both politically and privately.</p>

<p class="ind">I have seen almost all my other Ministers, and do regular,
hard, but to <i>me delightful</i>, work with them. It is to me the
<i>greatest pleasure</i> to do my duty for my country and my people,
and no fatigue, however great, will be burdensome to me if it
is for the welfare of the nation. Stockmar will tell you all these
things. I have reason to be highly pleased with all my Ministers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.80" id="pagei.80"></a>[page&nbsp;80]</span>
and hope to God that the Elections<sup>57</sup> may be favourable,
as I well know that the present Ministry is the best and most
moderate we can have.</p>

<p class="ind">Do not, my dearly beloved Uncle, fear for my health; I shall

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Laeken</span>, <i>27th June 1837</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dear Child</span>,&mdash;... Now I must touch on another subject
which is of vital importance for you and your comfort, viz.
the habits of business which you will contract now. The best
plan is to devote certain hours to it; if you do that, you will
get through it with great ease. I think you would do well to
tell your Ministers that for the present you would be ready to
receive those who should wish to see you between the hours of
eleven and half-past one. This will not plague you much, and
will be sufficient in most cases for the usual business that is to
be transacted.</p>

<p class="ind">I shall add to this a piece of advice. Whenever a question is
of some importance, it should not be decided on the day when
it is submitted to you. Whenever it is not an urgent one, I
make it a rule not to let any question be forced upon my
<i>immediate</i> decision; it is really not doing oneself justice <i>de
d&eacute;cider des questions sur le pouce</i>. And even when in my mind
I am disposed to accede, still I always keep the papers with me
some little time before I return them. The best mode for you
will be, that each Minister should bring his box with him, and
when he submits to you the papers, <i>explain them to you</i>. Then
you will keep the papers, either to think yourself upon it or to
consult somebody, and either return them the next time you
see the Minister to whom they belong, or send them to him.
Good habits formed <i>now</i> may for ever afterwards be kept up,
and will become so natural to you that you will not find them
at all fatiguing.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Albemarle mentioned yesterday to the Queen, that all
the ladies' saddle-horses, including the Queen-Dowager's own
favourite horses, belonged to the Queen; but it strikes her
that it would be well if the Queen was to give the Queen-Dowager
the choice of two or three of her own horses, and that
she might keep them. The Queen would wish Lord Melbourne

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Child</span>,&mdash;... I am glad to see that you are so
much pleased with Lord Melbourne. I believe him to be as
you think him. His character is a guarantee which is valuable,
and remember that <i>cleverness</i> and <i>talent</i>, <i>without an honest
heart and character</i>, <i>will never do for your Minister</i>. I shall
name nobody, but what I said just now applies to some people
you have recently seen.</p>

<p class="ind">I am so happy that you enter into the important affairs
which Providence has entrusted to you with so much interest
and spirit; if you continue you will be <i>sure of success</i>, and your
own conscience will give you the most delightful and satisfactory
feelings. To be <i>National</i> is the <i>great thing</i>, and I was sure
you would agree with what I said repeatedly to you on this
<i>vital subject</i>, and you will be certain in this way of the <i>love</i> of
the nation you govern.</p>

<p class="ind">I recommend to your kind attention what Stockmar will
think it his duty to tell you; he will never press anything,
never plague you with anything, without the thorough conviction
that it is indispensable for your welfare. I can guarantee
his independence of mind and disinterestedness; nothing
makes an impression upon him but what his experience makes
him feel to be of importance for you. I am delighted with your
plan. You will recollect that I pressed upon you repeatedly
how necessary it was for you to continue your studies on a more
<i>extended</i> scale, more appropriate to the station you were destined
once to fill. No one is better qualified to direct those
studies for the next few years than Stockmar, few people possess
more general information, and very, very few have been
like him educated, as it were, by fate itself since 1816. There
is no branch of information in which he may not prove useful&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.82" id="pagei.82"></a>[page&nbsp;82]</span>
<span class="rightnote">SUBJECTS FOR STUDY</span>
<p class="ind">(1) History, considered in a practical and philosophical way;
(2) International Law and everything connected with it;
(3) Political Economy, an important branch nowadays; (4)
Classic studies; (5) <i>belles lettres</i> in general; (6) Physical Science
in all its branches, etc., etc.&mdash;the list would be very long if I
were to enumerate it all. The <i>sooner</i> you do this the better;
in all countries and at all times men like Stockmar have filled
similar situations, even in the most bigoted and jealous countries,
such as Spain, Austria, etc. You will have him in this
case <i>constantly near you without</i> anybody having the right of
finding fault with it, and to be useful to you he should be near
you. Stockmar would have the <i>immense</i> advantage, for so
young a Queen, to be a <i>living</i> dictionary of all matters scientific
and politic that happened these thirty years, which to you is of
the greatest importance, because you <i>must study</i> the political
history of at least the last thirty-seven years <i>more particularly</i>.
I had begun something of the sort with you, even so far back as
George II.; you will do well to go through the reign of George
III., and to follow the various circumstances which brought on
finally the present state of affairs....</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Uncle</span>,&mdash;I had the happiness of receiving your
kind letter of 30th June yesterday, and hasten to thank you
for it. Your dear and kind letters, full of kind and excellent
advice, will always be of the greatest use to me, and will always
be my delight. You may depend upon it that I shall profit
by your advice, as I have already so often done.</p>

<p class="ind">I was sure you would be of my opinion relative to Lord
Melbourne. Indeed, dearest Uncle, nothing is to be done
without a good heart and an honest mind; I have, alas! seen so
much of bad hearts and dishonest and <i>double</i> minds, that I
know how to value and appreciate <i>real worth</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">All is going on well at present, and the elections promise to
be favourable. God grant they may be so! I had a very long
and highly interesting conversation with Palmerston on
Saturday, about Turkey, Russia, etc., etc. I trust something
may be done for my sister Queens. They have got a Constitution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.83" id="pagei.83"></a>[page&nbsp;83]</span>
in Spain at length, and the Cortes have done very well.
We hope also to conclude a treaty of commerce with the
Spaniards shortly, which would be an immense thing.</p>

<p class="ind">If you could get my kind and dear friend Louis Philippe,
whom I do so respect, and for whom I have a great affection, to
do something for poor Spain, it would be of great use.</p>

<p class="ind">I am quite <i>penetrated</i> by the King's kindness in sending good
old General Baudrand<sup>58</sup> and the Duc d'Elchingen<sup>59</sup> over to
compliment me; Baudrand did it very well, and with much
good feeling. In Portugal, affairs look very black, I grieve to
say. They have no money, and the <i>Chartists</i> want to bring
about another counter-revolution, which would be fatal to the
poor Queen's interests, I fear.</p>

<p class="ind">That you approve my plan about Stockmar I am delighted
to hear.</p>

<p class="ind">I hope to go into Buckingham Palace very shortly after the
funeral.</p>

<p class="ind">Now, dearest Uncle, I must invite you <i>en forme</i>. I should be
most <i>delighted</i> if you, dearest Aunt Louise, and Leopold
(<i>j'insiste</i>) could come about the <i>middle</i> or <i>end</i> of
<i>August</i>. Then
I should beg you would stay a little longer than usual, a fortnight
at <i>least</i>. You could bring as many gentlemen, ladies,
<i>bonnes</i>, etc., etc., as you pleased, and I should be <i>too</i> happy and
proud to have you under <i>my own</i> roof....</p>

<p class="ind">Went about half-past ten o'clock to Apsley House, and told
the Duke of Wellington the whole of my communication with
the Queen, Duchess of Kent, and Sir John Conroy on 15th June,
also of my communication subsequently with Lord Melbourne,
all of which he very much approved of. He said that he was
quite sure that the Queen would find Lord Melbourne an
honourable man, and one in whom Her Majesty might put confidence;
that he was a man apt to treat matters too lightly,
or, as he expressed it, a <i>poco curante</i>, but in the main an honest
and an honourable man. Upon my speaking to him of the
kind and paternal conduct of King Leopold towards his Niece,
he said that he was fully persuaded of this, and should at all and
any time be ready to uphold it by his approbation, but that he
had no immediate connection with the Press, whose attacks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.84" id="pagei.84"></a>[page&nbsp;84]</span>
indeed he held very cheap, though they were frequently very
offensive. He then asked me whether it was not true that the
Queen had thought of some reviews at which she would appear
on horseback. I said there had been some talk of it. He
desired me to say that he thought this would be very dangerous,
that she had much better do this in an open carriage, as no one
except such as himself knew how difficult it was to get steady
riding horses, and besides that, she could not be attended by
any female, and that this would appear indelicate.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Kensington Palace</span>, <i>10th July 1837</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen regrets very much to hear of Lord Melbourne's
indisposition, and trusts it will be of no duration.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has just seen the Lord Chamberlain and has given
him all her orders. The Lord Chamberlain says that he will
do everything in his power to facilitate the Queen's going into
Buckingham Palace on Thursday.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen fears that there may have been some mistake with
respect to the Chapter of the Garter, for Lord Conyngham,<sup>60</sup> as
well as several others, imagined it would be held on <i>Wednesday</i>
instead of <i>Friday</i>. The Queen requests Lord Melbourne to
rectify this mistake, as it is the Queen's intention to hold the
Chapter on <i>Friday</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest, best Uncle</span>,&mdash;... I have got very little time
and very little to say. I <i>really</i> and <i>truly</i> go into Buckingham
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.85" id="pagei.85"></a>[page&nbsp;85]</span>
Palace the day after to-morrow, but I must say, though I am
very glad to do so, I feel sorry to leave for <i>ever</i> my poor old
birthplace....</p>

<p class="ind"><i>25th</i>.&mdash;I shall not go out of town, I think, before the 20th
or thereabouts of next month. Windsor requires thorough
cleaning, and I must say I could not think of going in sooner
after the poor King's death. Windsor always appears very
melancholy to me, and there are so many sad associations with
it. These will vanish, I daresay, if I see you there soon after
my arrival there.</p>

<p class="ind">I have very pleasant large dinners every day. I invite my
Premier generally once a week to dinner as I think it right to
show publicly that I esteem him and have confidence in him, as
he has behaved so well. Stockmar is of this opinion and is his
great admirer....</p>

<span class="rightnote">MADAME DE LIEVEN</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Neuilly</span>, <i>12th July 1837</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">... Having still a few moments before a special messenger
sets off, I take advantage of it to add a few words. By all I
can hear, there are many intrigues on foot in England at this
moment. Princess Lieven<sup>61</sup> and another individual recently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.86" id="pagei.86"></a>[page&nbsp;86]</span>
imported from her country seem to be very active in what
concerns them not; beware of them. A rule which I cannot
sufficiently recommend is, <i>never to permit</i> people to speak
on subjects concerning yourself or your affairs, without your
having yourself desired them to do so. The moment a person
behaves improperly on this subject, change the conversation,
and make the individual feel that he has made a mistake....
People will certainly try to speak to you on your <i>own personal</i>
affairs; decline it boldly, and they will leave you alone....</p>

<p class="ind">Now I conclude with my warmest wishes for your happiness.
Ever, my dear Victoria, your faithfully attached Uncle and
Friend,</p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 61: The Princess Dorothea de Benckendorff married the Count de Lieven
at fifteen; in 1812, he became Russian Minister (and later Ambassador) in London, whither she
accompanied him. She was a woman of extraordinary cleverness, enjoying the confidence
of George IV., Liverpool, Canning, Castlereagh, and Wellington. Inspiring the
efforts, and even composing the despatches of her husband, she became herself the
confidential correspondent of Nesselrode, Esterhazy, Posso di Borgo, Guizot, and Lord Aberdeen.
In 1834, the Lievens returned to St Petersburg, where the Emperor Nicholas,
though indifferent to the society of women of talent, showed her special marks of regard. Her
husband died at Rome, in January 1838, and she established herself in Paris,
afterwards seeking a home in England during the troubles of 1848. Returning to Paris, her
<i>salon</i> became again the resort of diplomatists, politicians, and men of the world. She
died in January 1857.</p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: -0.5em;">Madame de Lieven about this time told Greville that she had had an audience of
the Queen, "who was very civil and gracious, but timid and embarrassed, and talked
of nothing but commonplaces"; and Greville adds that the Queen "had probably been
told that the Princess was an <i>intrigante</i>, and was afraid of committing
herself."</p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: -0.5em;">Madame de Lieven wrote to Lord Aberdeen on the 30th July 1837:&mdash;</p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: -0.5em;">J'ai vu la Reine deux fois, je l'ai vue seule, et je l'ai vue dans la soci&eacute;t&eacute; du
soir, et avec son Premier Ministre. Elle a un aplomb, un air de commandement, de dignit&eacute;, qui
avec son visage enfantin, sa petite taille, et son joli sourire, forment certainement
le spectacle le plus extraordinaire qu'il soit possible de se figurer. Elle est d'une extr&ecirc;me
r&eacute;serve dans son discours. On croit que la prudence est une de ses premi&egrave;res qualit&eacute;s. Lord
Melbourne a aupr&egrave;s d'elle un air d'amour, de contentement, de vanit&eacute; m&ecirc;me, et tout cela
m&ecirc;l&eacute; avec beaucoup de respect, des attitudes tr&egrave;s &agrave; son aise, une habitude de
premi&egrave;re place dans son salon, de la r&ecirc;verie, de la gaiet&eacute;, vous voyez tout cela. La
Reine est pleine d'aimables sourires pour lui.</p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: -0.5em;">La soci&eacute;t&eacute; le soir n'&eacute;tait compos&eacute;e que du household de la Reine, de tout le
household de la Duchesse de Kent (moins la famille Conroy, qui n'approche pas du Palais),
et de quelques &eacute;trangers. La Duchesse de Kent est parfaitement m&eacute;contente,&mdash;elle m'en
a m&ecirc;me parl&eacute;. Je doute que la m&egrave;re et la fllle habitent longtemps sous le m&ecirc;me toit.
Quant &agrave; Lord Melbourne, il me semble que la Duchesse le d&eacute;teste. Il est &eacute;vident
qu'il est dans la possession enti&egrave;re et exclusive de la confiance de la Reine, et que
ses ressentiments, comme ses peines pass&eacute;es, sont confi&eacute;s sans r&eacute;serve &agrave; son Premier Ministre....</p>

<p class="indright"><i>18th July 1837</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My beloved Uncle</span>,&mdash;... I have been so busy, I can say
but two words more, which are that I prorogued Parliament
yesterday in person, was very well received, and am not at all
tired to-day, but quite frisky. There is to be no review <i>this

<p class="ind">... With regard to Count Orloff,<sup>62</sup> your Majesty will probably
renew to him, on his taking leave, the assurances which
your Majesty has already given, of your desire to cement and
maintain the friendly alliance which subsists between the two
Crowns; and an expression might be repeated of the pleasure
which your Majesty has derived from the selection of a person
who possesses the confidence and esteem of the Emperor so fully
as Count Orloff is known to do.</p>

<p class="ind">It might, perhaps, be as well to avoid any allusion to your
Majesty's not being personally acquainted with the Emperor,
or anything that might be construed into an invitation to that
Sovereign to come to England, because Viscount Palmerston
has reason to believe that any such hint would be eagerly
caught at, while at the same time such a visit does not, under all
circumstances, seem to be a thing particularly to be desired....</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Child</span>,&mdash;... I hear that the Lev&eacute;e went off very
well, and I have no doubt that the Drawing-Room did the
same. Your <i>spirit</i> in all these new and trying proceedings
makes me <i>happy beyond expression</i>. Believe me, with <i>courage</i>
and <i>honesty</i>, you will get on beautifully and successfully. The
firmness you displayed at the beginning of your reign will be
for your quiet of the utmost importance. People must come
to the opinion <i>it is of no use intriguing, because when her mind is
once made up, and she thinks a thing right</i>, no earthly power will
make her change. To these qualities must be added one which
is of great importance, this is <i>discretion</i>; humble as it seems, it
has often brought about successes in which talent failed and
genius did not succeed. Discretion in the great affairs of the
world does wonders, and safety depends frequently and is
chiefly derived from it....</p>

<i>not permit</i> anybody, be it even your Prime Minister, to speak to
you on matters that concern you <i>personally</i>, without <i>your</i>
having expressed the wish of its being done. You have no
idea of the importance of this for your peace and comfort and
safety. I always act on this principle, and I can say with great
success.</p>

favourably to the Ministry, it will, I hope, give them the means

of trying to <i>conciliate</i> the great mass of the <i>moderate</i> Tories, who
from their nature and in consequence of their opinions are safe
and desirable supporters of the Crown. The two extremes will
give them trouble, and the ultra-Tories appear to me to be even
the <i>more unreasonable</i> of the two.</p>

<p class="ind">I am most happy to see you on your guard against Princess
Lieven and such-like people. Your life amongst intriguers and
tormented with intrigues has given you an experience on this
important subject which you will do well not to lose sight of, as
it will unfortunately often <i>reproduce itself</i>, though the names
and manner of carrying on the thing may not be the same.</p>

<p class="ind">I also think Windsor a little melancholy, but I believe that
one likes it more and more, as the Park in particular is uncommonly
beautiful. We shall try our best to enliven it by our

it will go a great way to ensure your success, and your spirit and

of the result of the elections, which, with the exception
of one or two doubtful counties in Ireland, may be said to be
completed....</p>

<p class="ind">It is not to be denied that this near balance of parties makes
the task of conducting the government difficult for any
Ministry. On the other hand, the circumstances of the country
do not present any extraordinary difficulty, and were any such
to arise, the general composition of the new House of Commons
affords a security that the maintenance of the Constitution and
the welfare of the country would be permanent objects to the
majority of its Members.<sup>67</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell had some time ago the honour of stating
to your Majesty that the return of Mr Fox Maule for Perthshire,
and of Mr Hume for Middlesex, were hardly to be
expected. In this as in many other instances the superior
organisation of the Tory party have enabled them to gain the
appearance of a change of opinion, which has not in fact taken
place.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell is sorry to add that bribery, intimidation,
and drunkenness have been very prevalent at the late elections,
and that in many cases the disposition to riot has only been
checked by the appearance of the Military, who have in all
cases conducted themselves with great temper and judgment.</p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 67: While the extreme Radicals were in several cases defeated, the
number of O'Connell's followers was decidedly increased. The general balance of parties was not much
affected, though the complaint made by Mr Roebuck, the Radical Member for Bath, in the
last days of William IV.'s reign, that there was no Government, and that the
machinery of legislation was at a dead stop, was no longer warranted.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and in acknowledging your Majesty's gracious communication,
of yesterday returns his thanks for the very lively account
which your Majesty has given of the journey and the entrance
into Brighton. Lord Melbourne entirely partakes in the
wish your Majesty has been graciously pleased to express
that he had been there to witness the scene; but your Majesty
will at once perceive that it was better that he was not, as in
that case Lord Melbourne would have been accused of an
attempt to take a political advantage of the general enthusiasm
and to mix himself and the Government with your Majesty's
personal popularity. Lord Melbourne fears that for some

<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.93" id="pagei.93"></a>[page&nbsp;93]</span>
one a week would be sufficient. You know now that all letters
are read, and that should not be <i>always</i> the case with ours.
There is, however, one thing about which I think it right to
warn you. This way of reading people's letters is often taken
advantage of by the writers of them, who are <i>not so ignorant
of the thing as is imagined</i> to write the very subject which they
wish to convey to the ears of persons without compromising
themselves. I will give you an example: we are still plagued
by Prussia concerning those fortresses; now, to tell the
Prussian Government many things, which we <i>should not like</i> to
tell them <i>officially</i>, the Minister is going to write a despatch
to our man at Berlin, sending it <i>by post</i>; the Prussians <i>are
sure</i> to read it, and to learn in this way what we wish them to
hear. The diplomats in England may resort to this same mode
of proceeding to injure people, to calumniate, and to convey
to your knowledge such things as they may hope to have the
effect of injuring some people <i>they may fear</i>, in your eyes. I
tell you the <i>trick</i>, that you should be able to guard against it;
it is of importance, and I have no doubt will be resorted to
by various political people.... Ever, my dearest Victoria,
your faithfully devoted Uncle and Friend,</p>

<span class="rightnote" style="margin-top: 2em;">LOUIS PHILIPPE'S POLICY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Trianon</span>, <i>19th October 1837</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Victoria</span>,&mdash;... There is a great disposition
here to be on the best possible terms with England. As it has
but too often happened that the diplomatic agents of the two
countries have drawn, or been believed to draw, different ways,<span class="rightnote">COUNT MOL&Eacute;</span>
I recommended strongly to Count Mol&eacute;<sup>71</sup> to give strong and
clear instructions to his people, particularly at Madrid, Lisbon,
and Athens.... He is going to read them to Lord Granville,
and also to communicate as much as possible all the despatches
of the French diplomats to the English Government. This
will be a proof of confidence, and it will besides have the
advantage of giving often useful information, enabling thereby
the English Government to hear two opinions instead of one.
It cannot be denied that the idea that the Plenipotentiaries
of the two countries were following two different lines of policy
has been hurtful to the causes of the two Queens in the
Peninsula. To put a stop to this double action is the only
benefit which the Queens will at present derive from a better
understanding between England and France; but as it is, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.94" id="pagei.94"></a>[page&nbsp;94]</span>
will be still of some importance to them, and take away from
the different political parties the possibility of using the pretended
misunderstanding against the Government of the
Queens. I trust that you will tell your Ministers to meet this
friendly disposition with frankness and kindness. The wish
of the King here is, to have matters concerted between the
Plenipotentiaries of both countries. In this way it would
become difficult for the parties in Spain or Portugal to say that
the two Plenipotentiaries support different candidates for
Ministerial power, and the division in the parties connected
with the Queens might be in this manner <i>prevented</i> or <i>reconciled</i>.
Many and many are the ill-natured hints thrown out against
the King's policy here, and because he is clever, he is suspected
of having <i>ambitious schemes without end</i>; it may not be without
some importance to set this, in your mind at least, to rights.
Whatever may have been the King's views immediately after
the revolution of July<sup>72</sup> I will not decide; perhaps he may
a moment have wished to be able to do something for France.
Supposing this for the sake of argument to have been so, two
months of his reign were sufficient to show him that the great
question was not to conquer territories or foreign influence,
but to save Monarchy. He saw clearly that though <i>he</i> might
begin a war, necessarily it would soon degenerate into a war
of propaganda, and that he and his family would be the first
victims of it. His struggle has constantly been to strengthen
his Government, to keep together or create anew the elements
indispensable for a Monarchical Government, and this struggle
is far from being at its end, and most probably the remainder
of his life will be devoted to this important task; and whatever
may be the more lively disposition of the Duke of Orleans,
great part of his reign if he comes to the throne, and perhaps
the <i>whole</i> of it, will, <i>bon gr&eacute; mal gr&eacute;</i>, take the same turn. That
it should be so <i>is very natural</i>, because of <i>what use</i> would be
some <i>foreign provinces</i> if they would only add to the difficulty
of governing the old? Therefore, knowing as I do all the
proceedings of the King and his Cabinet, even more fully than
I do those of your Government; seeing constantly in the most
unreserved manner the whole of the despatches; knowing as
the nearest neighbour the system that they constantly followed
up towards us, I must say that no one is more against acquiring
influence in foreign States, or even getting burthened with
family aggrandisement in them, than he. He rejected most
positively the marriage of Joinville with Donna Maria because
he will not have anything to do with Portugal. He rejects a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.95" id="pagei.95"></a>[page&nbsp;95]</span>
<i>mille</i> times the idea of a future union of the Queen of Spain
with Aumale, because he will not have a son where it <i>is not</i>
his intention to support him.</p>

<p class="ind">His fear of being drawn into a real intervention has been the
cause of his having been so anxious not to have a French
Legion in Spain. He may be right or wrong on this subject&mdash;I
do not decide this, as I was of a different opinion last year;
but his fear of being drawn too far, like a man whose clothes
get caught by a steam-engine, is natural enough. His dislike
to the ultra-Liberals in the Peninsula is also very natural,
because they uphold principles of Government which render
Monarchy impossible, and the application of which to France
would be the ruin of the King. England, from the peculiarity
of its position, can do many things which in France would
upset everything.... I must close my letter, and shall
answer yours to-morrow. God bless you! Ever, my dearest
Victoria, your devoted Uncle,</p>

contents of a letter of Lord Granville's which we received
yesterday. Lord Granville complains a good deal of Mol&eacute;,<sup>73</sup>

towards us, and talks of his desire that we should be on a better
footing as to our foreign Ministers than we have hitherto been,
that whenever Lord Granville urges him to do anything decisive
(to use Lord G.'s own words) "he <i>shrinks</i> from the discussion,"
says he must have time to reflect before he can give
any answer, and evades giving any reply, whenever anything
of <i>importance</i> is required. This, you see, dear Uncle, is not
satisfactory. I merely tell you this, as I think you would like
to know what Mol&eacute; tells <i>our</i> Ambassador; this differs from
what he told <i>you</i>. What you say about Louis Philippe I am

difficult one....</p>

The Duc de Nemours has greatly distinguished himself. I am
sorry to see that in England people are sometimes <i>sufficiently
absurd</i> to be jealous of these French conquests. Nothing
indeed can be more absurd, as nothing is of greater <i>importance
to the peace</i> of Europe than that a powerful and military nation
like the French should have this outlet for their love of military
display. If one had named a council of wise men to fix upon
a spot where this might be done with <i>the least mischief</i> to the
rest of the world, one should have named the coast of Africa.
By their being there they will render to civilisation a country
which for about 800 years has been growing worse and worse,
and which was in the times of the Romans one of the richest
provinces. It settles, besides, upon the French a constant

would also oppose them. The commander, however, merely landed some men at Tripoli, and

respect to Ferdinand's question to you, it is impossible for <i>us</i>
to say <i>beforehand</i> <i>what</i> we <i>shall</i> do in <i>such</i> an

depends so entirely on the peculiar <i>circumstances</i> of the <i>moment</i>

that the fleet has orders to protect the King and Queen in case
they should be in any personal danger. As to Lord Howard,<sup>75</sup>

to recall him at present; it would give Bois le Comte<sup>76</sup> all the

In order to have a chance of arranging these troublesome affairs
it is necessary continually to see those who are principally engaged
in them. From a conversation which he has had this
evening with Lord Howick, Lord Melbourne has better hopes
of producing a general agreement upon Canadian affairs, but
the question of the administration of the Army, which is of
less immediate importance, is of more difficulty. Your Majesty
knows the importance attached by the King of the Belgians to
this matter. The opinion of the Duke of Wellington is also
strongly against the projected alteration. On the other hand,
five Cabinet Ministers have pledged themselves to it by signing
the report, and consider themselves as having publicly undertaken
to the House of Commons that some such measure shall
be proposed. Lord Melbourne has asked for the opinions of
Lord Hill<sup>85</sup> and Sir Hussey Vivian<sup>86</sup> in writing. When Lord
Melbourne receives them he must submit them to your Majesty
with as short and as clear a statement as he can make of a
question which is of a technical and official character, and with
which Lord Melbourne does not feel himself to be very familiar.
Lord Melbourne transmits a copy of the proposed Order in
Council to carry the recommendation of the report into effect,
which will acquaint your Majesty precisely what the powers
and duties are which it is intended to transfer from the Secretary
of State<sup>87</sup> to the Secretary-at-War. It is the more necessary
to be cautious, because it can be done without taking the
opinion or having recourse to the authority of Parliament.</p>

of such a decision entirely upon your Majesty. Lord Melbourne
will deem it his duty to offer your Majesty a decided
opinion upon the subject.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is much rejoiced to hear that your Majesty
enjoys Windsor. The Duchess of Sutherland,<sup>88</sup> who appreciates
both the grand and the beautiful, could not be otherwise than
delighted with it....</p>

Stafford House a great social centre. She was deeply interested in philanthropic and
social movements, such as the Abolition of Slavery, and had a strong sympathy for national
movements, which she showed by entertaining Garibaldi in 1864. She combined a considerable
sense of humour with a rare capacity for affection, and became one of the

<h3 style="margin-top: -0.5em;">TO CHAPTER VII</h3>


<p><span class="sc">The</span> Melbourne Ministry were able to maintain themselves in
office during the year (1838), but were too weak to carry important
measures. The prevailing distress led to much criticism of the Poor
Law Act of 1834, and the disturbances in Canada turned the tide of
emigration to Australia. But public interest in politics was eclipsed
by the gaieties of the Coronation, in which all ranks partook. The
events of Imperial importance elsewhere centred in Jamaica and
Canada, the apprenticeship system in the former place leading to a
renewal of the anti-slavery agitation at home, and the passing of a
Colonial Bill for absolute emancipation. The Canadian troubles
brought about the passing of an Imperial Act for the suspension for
two years of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada, and Lord
Durham, an impulsive and generous-hearted man, was sent out as
High Commissioner. Having dismissed the Executive Council of his
predecessor, he nominated a fresh one, but an ordinance thereafter
promulgated in reference to the rebels was severely criticised.
Lord Brougham, rejoicing at the opportunity of paying off old
scores, castigated the Government, especially Lord Glenelg, the
Colonial Secretary, and carried a measure censuring their Canadian
policy. The Ministry disallowed the ordinance of Lord Durham,
who, finding himself unsupported, resigned his Commission and
returned home. On his arrival at Plymouth, he made a speech, in
which he described the rebellion as finally at an end; the news,
however, subsequently arrived that after his departure from Canada,
disturbances had broken out afresh. Sir John Colborne was
appointed to succeed Lord Durham with full powers.</p>

<p>The Civil War continued in Spain through the year, and intermittent
rioting took place in Portugal, a country which was now
verging on bankruptcy. The old Dutch and Belgian controversy as
to the possession of Luxemburg was revived, the King of Holland,
who had obstinately withheld his concurrence for six years from the
Articles on the faith of which King Leopold accepted the throne of
Belgium, now showing overt hostility in the disputed territory. As
was natural, France was in sympathy with Belgium, and the two
countries entered into a treaty of commerce and reciprocity.</p>

whether in or out of office Lord Melbourne's conduct will
always be directed by the strongest attachment to your

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and has the honour of acknowledging your Majesty's gracious
communication, which he received this evening. Lord Melbourne
has this morning seen Lord Durham upon the subject of
his assuming the Government of Canada,<sup>1</sup> and has had a long
conversation with him. Lord Melbourne is to receive his final
answer before the Cabinet to-morrow, which meets at ten
o'clock. Lord Durham is anxious that your Majesty should
express to him your wish, or rather, as he phrased it, lay upon
him your commands that he should undertake this duty, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.104" id="pagei.104"></a>[page&nbsp;104]</span>
also that, as his absence will be but temporary, that Lady Durham<sup>2</sup>
should retain her situation in your Majesty's household.
Lord Melbourne thinks that your Majesty may properly gratify
him in both these points. Lord Durham made some other
stipulations, which Lord Melbourne will explain to your
Majesty, but, upon the whole, Lord Melbourne feels little
doubt that he will accept.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Glenelg<sup>3</sup> is on Monday to make a statement to the
House of Lords upon the subject of Canada, on which a debate
may not improbably arise by which Lord Melbourne may be
detained. On Wednesday there is neither House of Lords nor
Cabinet dinner. Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday will therefore
be festive days, on which Lord Melbourne will have great
pleasure in obeying your Majesty's commands and also on
Monday, if he should not be kept in the House of Lords.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne thinks it was prudent in your Majesty not
to expose yourself to the cold of the Chapel. He is himself
better, but has still much cough, though he has kept himself
very quiet and been very careful of his diet since he has been in
London.</p>

your welfare, and what is for the good of your Empire. I wish

very much that you would speak with him on the subject of
what ought to be done to keep for the Crown the little influence
it still may possess. His views on this important subject are
the more trustworthy as he always has belonged to the moderate
Liberals, and therefore has had the means of judging the
matter with great impartiality. Monarchy to be carried on
requires certain elements, and the occupation of the Sovereign
must be constantly to <i>preserve these elements</i>, or should they
have been too much weakened by untoward circumstances, to
contrive by every means to <i>strengthen them again</i>. You are too
clever not to know, that it is <i>not</i> the being <i>called</i> Queen or King,
which can be of the <i>least consequence</i>, when to the title there is
not also annexed the power indispensable for the exercise of
those functions. All trades must be learned, and nowadays

difficult one</i>.</p>

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Viscount Palmerston to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">DEPARTMENTS OF STATE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Stanhope Street</span>, <i>25th February 1838</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and with reference to your Majesty's question upon
the subjects to which Lord William Russell's recent despatch
relates, he has the honour to state: that in the Governments of
the Continent, and more especially in those which have no
representative Assemblies, the second class of persons in the
public offices possess and exercise much more power and influence
than the corresponding class of persons do in this country.
In England the Ministers who are at the head of the
several departments of the State, are liable any day and every
day to defend themselves in Parliament; in order to do this,
they must be minutely acquainted with all the details of the
business of their offices, and the only way of being constantly
armed with such information is to conduct and direct those
details themselves.</p>

<p class="ind">On the Continent, where Ministers of State are not liable so
to be called to account for their conduct, the Ministers are
tempted to leave the details of their business much more to
their Under-Secretaries and to their chief clerks. Thus it
happens that all the routine of business is generally managed
by these subordinate agents; and to such an extent is this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.107" id="pagei.107"></a>[page&nbsp;107]</span>
carried, that Viscount Palmerston believes that the Ministers
for Foreign Affairs, in France, Austria, Prussia, and Russia,
seldom take the trouble of writing their own despatches,
except, perhaps, upon some very particular and important
occasion.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty will easily see how greatly such a system must
place in the hands of the subordinate members of the public
departments the power of directing the policy and the measures
of the Government; because the value and tendency, and the
consequences of a measure, frequently depend as much upon
the manner in which that measure is worked out, as upon the
intention and spirit with which it was planned.</p>

<p class="ind">Another circumstance tends also to give great power to these
second-class men, and that is their permanence in office.</p>

<p class="ind">In England when, in consequence of some great political
change, the Heads of Departments go out, the greater part of
the Under-Secretaries go out also; thus the Under-Secretary
(with two or three exceptions) having come in with his Chief,
has probably no more experience than his Chief, and can seldom
set up his own knowledge to overrule the opinion, or to guide
the judgment, of his superior.</p>

<p class="ind">But on the Continent, changes of Ministers are oftener
changes of individual men from personal causes, than changes
of parties from political convulsions; and therefore when the
Chief retires, the Under-Secretary remains. There are consequently
in all the public offices abroad a number of men who
have spent the greater part of their lives in their respective
departments, and who by their long experience are full
of knowledge of what has been done in former times, and
of the most convenient and easy manner of doing what
may be required in the time present. This affords to
the Chiefs an additional motive for leaning upon their
subordinates, and gives to those subordinates still more real
influence.</p>
<span class="rightnote">BUREAUCRACY</span>
<p class="ind">This class of subordinate men has, from the fact of its being
possessed of so much power, been invested by the jargon of the
day with the title of "Bureaucratic"&mdash;a name fabricated in
imitation of the words "aristocratic" and "democratic," each
being compounded of the word "cratic," which is a corruption
from the Greek word "kratos," which means power; and the
prefix, denoting the particular class of society whose power is
meant to be expressed. Thus "<i>aristo</i>-cratic" is the power of
the upper, or, as in Greek it is called, the "aristos" class of
society; "<i>demo</i>-cratic" is the power of the people, which
in Greek is called the "demos"; and "<i>bureau</i>-cratic"
is the power of the public offices or "bureaus," for which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.108" id="pagei.108"></a>[page&nbsp;108]</span>
latter the French name has been taken instead of a Greek
word.</p>

<p class="ind">It appears, then, to be the opinion of Lord William Russell,
that this second class of public men in Prussia are animated by
a desire to see the general policy of their country rendered more
national and independent than it has hitherto been; that for
this purpose they were desirous of urging on the Government
to take its stand against foreign influence upon some point or
other, not much caring what that point might be; that they
thought it would be difficult to choose a political question,
because on such a question the King of Prussia might be against
them, and that consequently they chose a religious question, on
which they knew they should have the King with them; and
that accordingly they led the Government on to a quarrel with
the Court of Rome, and with the Catholic or Austrian party in
Germany, more with a view to place Prussia in an independent
national position than from any particular importance which
they attached to the question itself upon which the rupture
was to be effected.</p>

paupers, either in kind or money. The Act of that year was based on the principle that
no one must perish through the want of the bare necessities of life. Poor Law Commissioners
were established, England was divided into Districts, and the Districts into
Unions. Out-door relief was to be given, on the order of two justices, to poor persons
wholly unable, from age or infirmity, to work. But there was much opposition to the
new law; it was considered a grievance that old couples were refused relief at home,
and that the sexes must be separated at the workhouse, to which the name of "Bastille"
began to be attached. In Devonshire it was even believed that the bread distributed
by the relieving officers was mixed with poisonous ingredients.</p>

<p class="ind">... Concerning the education of our friend Albert, it has
been the best plan you could have fixed upon, to name Stockmar
your commissary-general; it will give <i>unit&eacute; d'action et de
l'ensemble</i>, which otherwise we should not have had. I have
communicated to him what your uncle and the young gentleman
seem to wish, and what strikes me as the best for the
moment. Stockmar will make a regular report to you on this
subject. They will return to Bonn at the beginning of May,
and remain till the end of August.... I agree with this, as
nothing enlarges the mind so much as travelling. But
Stockmar will best treat this affair verbally with you. The
young gentlemen wished to pay me another visit at the
beginning of May, prior to their return to Bonn. Nothing
definite is, however, as yet settled about it. On one thing you
can rely, that it is my <i>great anxiety</i> to see Albert a <i>very good</i>
and
<i>distinguished young man</i>, and <i>no pains will be thought too much</i>
on my part if this end can be attained....</p>

distinguishing himself at Austerlitz in 1805, he was made Duke of Dalmatia in 1807.
Serving in the Peninsular War, he pursued Moore to Corunna, and became Commander-in-Chief
in Spain in 1809. Subsequently he conducted the French retreat before Wellington
in Southern France, 1813-14; was banished, but recalled and created a peer. He
was Minister of War 1830-34.</p>

learnt the <i>sad</i> loss we have all sustained in the death of <i>dearest</i>,

struggle or a suffering, on Sunday night at nine o'clock. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.112" id="pagei.112"></a>[page&nbsp;112]</span>
don't think I have <i>ever</i> been so much overcome or distressed by
anything, almost, as by the death of this my earliest friend; it
is the first link that has been broken of my first and infantine
affections. I always loved Louie, and shall cherish her
memory as that of the purest and best of mortals as long as I
live! I took leave of her before I left London on Wednesday,
and <i>never</i>, <i>never</i> shall I forget the blessing she gave me, and the
grasp she gave my hand! I was quite upset by it! And I
feared and felt I should behold her on earth no more; it was,
however, a beautiful lesson of calmness and contentment and
resignation to the will of her God! Prepared as she was at
every moment of her life to meet her heavenly Father, she was
full of hope of recovery, and quite unconscious of her approaching
end. You will, I am sure, dearest Uncle, feel the
loss of this excellent creature; I cannot restrain my tears
while writing this. One great consolation I have, which is,
that I have been the means of making her last days as happy
as she could wish to be, after having lost what she loved most!</p>

<p class="ind">... Poor <i>Mason</i>, our faithful coachman for so many years,

see those whom one has known from one's birth drop off, one

Palmerston, with Lord Aberdeen, for instance, of whose sweetness
the Greek negotiation<sup>14</sup> has given me very fair means of
judging. Now I will conclude by touching on one subject
which concerns your great goodness to us. When we left
England you expressed a wish to see us at the time of the
Coronation, which was then believed to take place at the end
of May. More mature reflection has made me think that a
King and Queen at your dear Coronation might perhaps be a
<i>hors-d'&oelig;uvre</i>, and I think, if it meets with your approbation,
that it may be better to pay you our respects at some other
period, which you might like to fix upon. I do not deny that
having been deprived by circumstances from the happiness of
wishing you joy at your birthday, since 1831, in person, I feel
strongly tempted to make a short apparition to see you, as
seeing and speaking is much pleasanter than ink and paper....</p>

of seeing you and my dearest Aunt, I shall now respectfully
state my feelings. It would have made me very happy to see
you both at the Coronation, but I think upon the whole it is
perhaps better you should not do so. Then, with respect to
your coming for my <i>old</i> birthday, I must observe that I could
not enjoy you or my Aunt at all <i>&agrave; mon aise</i>. First of all, I
could not lodge you, and if one is not in the same house together,
there is <i>no real</i> seeing one another; secondly, the town
will be so full of all sorts of foreigners that I should have <i>no
peace</i> to see you and Aunt quietly. If therefore, dearest Uncle,
it suits you and Aunt Louise, would you come about the end of
August, and stay with me as long as you can? I trust, dearest
Uncle, <i>que vous me comprendrez bien</i>, and that you are assured
of the great happiness it is for me to see you at any time.</p>

<p class="ind">Since I have written to you we have received from Lord
Granville the news of Marshal Soult's appointment as Ambassador

the dear French family. With regard to Soult, I am sure you
are aware that whoever the King chose to send would be
equally well received by me and the Government.</p>

<p class="ind">That you hope that the King and Queen of Portugal will not consider

them. That there is every disposition to make allowance for the
difficulties of Portugal, but allowance must also be made for the
feelings of the people of England; that those feelings on the Slave
Trade are as strong as they are just. That England has made great
sacrifices for the suppression of that crime, that she has made sacrifices
to Portugal, and that she has been extremely indignant at finding
that traffic so obstinately continued to be sheltered and protected
under the flag of Portugal. That Portugal must not expect
that England will much longer refrain from taking effectual measures
for preventing these practices. That you have spoken thus openly
because you wish them to be aware of the truth, and that you entreat
both the Queen and the King to use their power and influence
in procuring such a treaty to be concluded without delay, as will
satisfy England and exonerate Portugal from the reproach under
which she now labours.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Laeken</span>, <i>2nd June 1838</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">... I have not all this time touched on our affairs, from
motives of <i>great discretion</i>, but as the battle draws nigh,<sup>17</sup> I cannot
very well help writing a few words on the subject. I found
an Article in the French <i>Constitutionnel</i> which paints our
position in pretty true colours. As it is not very long, I beg
you to have the goodness to read it. You have given me so
many proofs of affection, and your kind speech at Windsor is
so fresh in my memory, that it would be <i>very wrong</i> in me to
think that in so short a time, and without any cause, those
feelings which are so <i>precious</i> to me could have changed. This
makes me appeal to those sentiments.</p>

<p class="ind">The independent existence of the Provinces which form this
Kingdom has always been an object of importance to England;
the surest proof of it is, that for centuries England has made the
greatest sacrifices of blood and treasure for that object. The
last time I saw the late King at Windsor, in 1836, he said
to me: "If ever France or any other Power invades your
country, it will be a question of immediate war for England;
we cannot suffer that." I answered him I was happy to
hear him speak so, as I also did not want any foreign Power
to invade us....</p>

<p class="ind">All I want from your kind Majesty is, that you will <i>occasionally</i>
express to your Ministers, and particularly to good
Lord Melbourne, that, as far as it is <i>compatible</i> with the interests
<i>of your own</i> dominions, you do <i>not</i> wish that your
Government should take the <i>lead</i> in such measures as might in
a short time bring on the <i>destruction</i> of this country, as well as
that of your uncle and his family.</p>

<p class="ind">Europe has enjoyed ever since 1833, in our part of it, a state
of <i>profound peace</i> and real happiness and prosperity. None
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.117" id="pagei.117"></a>[page&nbsp;117]</span>
can deny that the measures which I adopted to organise this
country have greatly contributed to this happy state of
affairs; this makes me think that the changes which are to
take place should be brought about in a <i>very gentle manner</i>....</p>

<p class="ind">I am sorry to have you to listen to so much about politics,
but it is not my fault; I wished nothing so much as <i>to be left
alone</i>. I shall do all I can to bring about a good conclusion,
but it must not be forgotten that these seven years <i>all the

must in turn say, dearest Uncle, that your silence was longer

I know, however, you have had, and still have, <i>much</i> to do.
Many thanks, my dear Uncle, for your very kind letter of the

<p class="ind">It would indeed, dearest Uncle, be <i>very wrong</i> of you, if you
thought my feelings of warm and devoted attachment to you,
and of great affection for you, could be changed. <i>Nothing</i> can
ever change them! Independent of my feelings of affection
for you, my beloved Uncle, you must be aware that the ancient
and hereditary policy of this country with respect to Belgium
must make me most anxious that my Government not <i>only</i>
should not be parties to any measure that would be prejudicial
to Belgium, but that my Ministers should, as far as
may not conflict with the interests or engagements of this
country, do <i>everything</i> in their power to promote the prosperity
and welfare of your Kingdom.</p>

<p class="ind">My Ministers, I can assure you, share all my feelings on this
subject, and are most anxious to see everything settled in a
satisfactory manner between Belgium and Holland.</p>
<span class="rightnote">PROGRESS OF BELGIUM</span>
<p class="ind">We all feel that we cannot sufficiently or adequately express
how much Belgium owes to your wise system of government,
which has rendered that country so flourishing in every way,
and how much all Europe is indebted to you for the preservation
of general peace; because it is certain that when you
ascended the throne of Belgium that country was the one
from which the occasion of a general war was much to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.118" id="pagei.118"></a>[page&nbsp;118]</span>
feared; whereas now it is become a link to secure the continuance
of peace; and by the happy circumstances of your
double near relationship to me and to the King of the French,
<i>Belgium</i>&mdash;which was in former times the cause of discord
between England and France&mdash;becomes now a mutual tie to
keep them together.</p>

<p class="ind">This, my beloved Uncle, we owe to you, and it must be a
source of pride and gratification to you.</p>

<p class="ind">I perfectly understand and feel that your position with
respect to all these affairs is very difficult and trying, and the
feelings of your subjects are far from unnatural; yet I sincerely
hope that you will use the great influence you possess
over the minds of the leading men in Belgium, to mitigate discontent
and calm irritation, and procure acquiescence in
whatever arrangements may ultimately be found inevitable.</p>

<p class="ind">You are right in saying that I, though but a child of twelve
years old when you went to Belgium, remember much of what
took place, and I have since then had the whole matter fully
explained to me. The Treaty of November 1831 was perhaps
not so advantageous to the Belgians as could have been wished,
yet it cannot have been thought very advantageous to the
Dutch, else they would have most probably urged their
Government before this time to accept it; besides, when these
conditions were framed, England was only one out of <i>five</i>
Powers whose concurrence was required, and consequently
they were made under very difficult circumstances. This
treaty having been ratified, it is become binding, and therefore
it is almost impossible to consider it as otherwise, and to set
aside those parts of it which have been ratified by all the
parties.</p>

<p class="ind">I feel I must in turn, dearest Uncle, entreat your indulgence
for so long a letter, and for such full explanations, but I felt it
my duty to do so, as you had spoken to me on the subject.</p>

<p class="ind">You may be assured, my beloved Uncle, that both Lord
Melbourne and Lord Palmerston are most anxious at all times
for the prosperity and welfare of Belgium, and are consequently
most desirous of seeing this difficult question brought to a conclusion
which may be satisfactory to you. Allow me once
more therefore, dearest Uncle, to beseech you to use your
powerful influence over your subjects, and to strive to moderate
their excited feelings on these matters. Your situation is a
very difficult one, and nobody feels more for you than I do.</p>

me your devoted and most affectionate Niece,</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest and most beloved Victoria</span>,&mdash;You have
written me a <i>very dear</i> and long letter, which has given me <i>great
pleasure and satisfaction</i>. I was much moved with the expressions
of truly felt affection, which it contains, and I shall
<i>never</i> again doubt your affection for me, but rely on your dear
heart and the constancy of your character.</p>

<p class="ind">I will now tell you honestly that I had some misgivings; I
did not exactly think that you had quite forgotten me, but I
thought I had been put aside as one does with a piece of furniture
which is no longer wanted. I did not complain, because I
fear if affection is once on the decline, reproaches only diminish
it the faster. I therefore said nothing, but in a life full of grief
and disappointments like mine, the loss of your affection would
have been one of the most severe. It was in this point of view
that the declaration made by Lord Palmerston at the beginning
of May to the Prussian Government chagrined me much.<sup>19</sup> It
was premature, because the negotiation was not yet renewed.
It looked as if the English Government had been anxious to say
to the Northern Powers, who always steadfastly <i>protected</i>
Holland, "You imagine, perhaps, that we mean to have <i>&eacute;gards</i>
for the uncle of the Queen; there you see we shall make even
shorter work with him now than we did under our late master."</p>

<p class="ind">This impression had been <i>general</i> on the Continent; they
considered the declaration to Prussia in this way: "La Reine
et ses Ministres sont donc enti&egrave;rement indiff&eacute;rents sur le compte
du Roi L.; <i>cela change enti&egrave;rement</i> la position, et nous allons
faire mains basses sur lui." From that moment their language
became extremely imperious; they spoke of nothing but acts of
coercion, bombardment, etc., etc. I firmly believe, because I
have been these many years on terms of great and sincere friendship
with Palmerston, that he did not himself quite foresee the
importance which would be attached to his declaration. I must
say it hurt me more in my <i>English</i> capacity than in my Belgian,
as I came to this country <i>from England</i>, and was chosen <i>for
that very reason</i>. Besides, I am happy to say, I was never as yet
in the position to ask for any act of kindness from you, so that
whatever little service I may have rendered you, remained on a
basis of perfect disinterestedness. That the first diplomatic
step in our affairs should seem by your Government to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.120" id="pagei.120"></a>[page&nbsp;120]</span>
directed against me, created therefore all over the Continent a
considerable sensation. I shall never ask any favours of you,
or anything that could in the least be considered as <i>incompatible</i>
with the interests of England; but you will comprehend
that there is a great difference in claiming favours and in being
treated as an enemy....</p>

<p class="ind">I will conclude my overgrown letter with the assurance that
you never were in greater favour, and that I love you dearly.

Sutherland, and Lady Barham, all in their robes.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE ABBEY</span>

<p class="ind2" style="margin-top: 1em;">At 10 I got into the State Coach with the Duchess of Sutherland
and Lord Albemarle and we began our Progress. I subjoin
a minute account of the whole Procession and of the whole
Proceeding,&mdash;the route, etc. It was a fine day, and the crowds
of people exceeded what I have ever seen; many as there were
the day I went to the City, it was nothing, nothing to the
multitudes, the millions of my loyal subjects, who were
assembled <i>in every spot</i> to witness the Procession. Their good
humour and excessive loyalty was beyond everything, and I
really cannot say <i>how</i> proud I feel to be the Queen of <i>such</i> a
Nation. I was alarmed at times for fear that the people would
be crushed and squeezed on account of the tremendous rush
and pressure.</p>

<p class="ind2">I reached the Abbey amid deafening cheers at a little after half-past
eleven; I first went into a robing-room quite close to the
entrance where I found my eight train-bearers: Lady Caroline
Lennox, Lady Adelaide Paget, Lady Mary Talbot, Lady Fanny
Cowper, Lady Wilhelmina Stanhope, Lady Anne Fitzwilliam,
Lady Mary Grimston, and Lady Louisa Jenkinson&mdash;all dressed
alike and beautifully in white satin and silver tissue with
wreaths of silver corn-ears in front, and a small one of pink
roses round the plait behind, and pink roses in the trimming of
the dresses.</p>

<p class="ind2">After putting on my mantle, and the young ladies having
properly got hold of it and Lord Conyngham holding the end of
it, I left the robing-room and the Procession began as is described
in the annexed account, and all that followed and took
place. The sight was splendid; the bank of Peeresses quite
beautiful all in their robes, and the Peers on the other side.
My young train-bearers were always near me, and helped me
whenever I wanted anything. The Bishop of Durham<sup>21</sup> stood
on the side near me, but he was, as Lord Melbourne told me,
remarkably <i>maladroit</i>, and never could tell me what was to take
place. At the beginning of the Anthem, where I've made a
mark, I retired to St Edward's Chapel, a dark small place immediately
behind the Altar, with my ladies and train-bearers&mdash;took
off my crimson robe and kirtle, and put on the supertunica
of cloth of gold, also in the shape of a kirtle, which was put over
a singular sort of little gown of linen trimmed with lace; I also
took off my circlet of diamonds and then proceeded bareheaded
into the Abbey; I was then seated upon St Edward's
chair, where the Dalmatic robe was clasped round me by the
Lord Great Chamberlain. Then followed all the various
things; and last (of those things) the Crown being placed on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.122" id="pagei.122"></a>[page&nbsp;122]</span>
my head&mdash;which was, I must own, a most beautiful impressive
moment; <i>all</i> the Peers and Peeresses put on their coronets at
the same instant.</p>

<p class="footnote1">Footnote 21: Edward Maltby, 1770-1859.</p>

<p class="ind2" style="margin-top: 1em;">My excellent Lord Melbourne, who stood very close to me
throughout the whole ceremony, was <i>completely</i> overcome at
this moment, and very much affected; he gave me <i>such</i> a kind,
and I may say <i>fatherly</i> look. The shouts, which were very
great, the drums, the trumpets, the firing of the guns, all at the
same instant, rendered the spectacle most imposing.</p>

<span class="rightnote">HOMAGE</span>

<p class="ind2">The Enthronisation and the Homage of, first, all the Bishops,
and then my Uncles, and lastly of all the Peers, in their respective
order was very fine. The Duke of Norfolk (holding
for me the Sceptre with a Cross) with Lord Melbourne stood
close to me on my right, and the Duke of Richmond with the
other Sceptre on my left, etc., etc. All my train-bearers, etc.,
standing behind the Throne. Poor old Lord Rolle, who is 82,
and dreadfully infirm, in attempting to ascend the steps fell
and rolled quite down, but was not the least hurt; when he
attempted to re-ascend them I got up and advanced to the end
of the steps, in order to prevent another fall. When Lord
Melbourne's turn to do Homage came, there was loud cheering;
they also cheered Lord Grey and the Duke of Wellington; it's
a pretty ceremony; they first all touch the Crown, and then
kiss my hand. When my good Lord Melbourne knelt down
and kissed my hand, he pressed my hand and I grasped his
with all my heart, at which he looked up with his eyes filled
with tears and seemed much touched, as he was, I observed,
throughout the whole ceremony. After the Homage was concluded
I left the Throne, took off my Crown and received the
Sacrament; I then put on my Crown again, and re-ascended
the Throne, leaning on Lord Melbourne's arm. At the commencement
of the Anthem I descended from the Throne, and
went into St Edward's Chapel with my Ladies, Train-bearers,
and Lord Willoughby, where I took off the Dalmatic robe,
supertunica, etc., and put on the Purple Velvet Kirtle and
Mantle, and proceeded again to the Throne, which I ascended
leaning on Lord Melbourne's hand.</p>

<p class="ind2">There was another most dear Being present at this ceremony,
in the box immediately above the royal box, and who
witnessed all; it was my dearly beloved angelic Lehzen, whose
eyes I caught when on the Throne, and we exchanged smiles.
She and Sp&auml;th, Lady John Russell, and Mr. Murray saw me
leave the Palace, arrive at the Abbey, leave the Abbey and
again return to the Palace!!</p>

<span class="rightnote">POPULAR ENTHUSIASM</span>

<p class="ind2">I then again descended from the Throne, and repaired with
all the Peers bearing the Regalia, my Ladies and Trainbearers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.123" id="pagei.123"></a>[page&nbsp;123]</span>
to St Edward's Chapel, as it is called; but which, as
Lord Melbourne said, was more <i>un</i>like a Chapel than anything
he had ever seen; for what was <i>called</i> an <i>Altar</i> was covered
with sandwiches, bottles of wine, etc., etc. The Archbishop
came in and <i>ought</i> to have delivered the Orb to me, but I had
already got it, and he (as usual) was <i>so</i> confused and puzzled
and knew nothing, and&mdash;went away. Here we waited some
minutes. Lord Melbourne took a glass of wine, for he seemed
completely tired. The Procession being formed, I replaced
my Crown (which I had taken off for a few minutes), took the
Orb in my left hand and the Sceptre in my right, and thus
<i>loaded</i>, proceeded through the Abbey&mdash;which resounded with
cheers, to the first robing-room; where I found the Duchess of
Gloucester, Mamma, and the Duchess of Cambridge with their
Ladies. And here we waited for at least an hour, with <i>all</i> my
ladies and train-bearers; the Princesses went away about
half an hour before I did. The Archbishop had (most awkwardly)
put the ring on the wrong finger, and the consequence
was that I had the greatest difficulty to take it off again, which
I at last did with great pain. Lady Fanny, Lady Wilhelmina,
and Lady Mary Grimston looked quite beautiful. At about
half-past four I re-entered my carriage, the Crown on my head,
and the Sceptre and Orb in my hands, and we proceeded the
same way as we came&mdash;the crowds if possible having increased.
The enthusiasm, affection, and loyalty were really touching,
and I shall ever remember this day as the <i>Proudest</i> of my life!
I came home at a little after six, really <i>not</i> feeling tired.</p>

<span class="rightnote">INCIDENTS OF THE CORONATION</span>

<p class="ind2">At eight we dined. Besides we thirteen&mdash;my Uncles, sister,
brother, Sp&auml;th, and the Duke's gentlemen&mdash;my excellent Lord
Melbourne and Lord Surrey dined here. Lord Melbourne
came up to me and said: "I must congratulate you on this
most brilliant day," and that all had gone off so well. He said
he was not tired, and was in high spirits. I sat between Uncle
Ernest<sup>22</sup> and Lord Melbourne; and Lord Melbourne between
me and Feodore, whom he had led in. My kind Lord Melbourne
was much affected in speaking of the whole ceremony.
He asked kindly if I was tired; said the Sword he carried (the
first, the Sword of State) was excessively heavy. I said that
the Crown hurt me a good deal. He was so much amused at
Uncle Ernest's being astonished at our still having the Litany.
We agreed that the whole thing was a very fine sight. He
thought the robes, and particularly the Dalmatic, "looked
remarkably well." "And you did it all so well&mdash;excellent!"
said he, with tears in his eyes. He said he thought I looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.124" id="pagei.124"></a>[page&nbsp;124]</span>
rather pale and "moved by all the people" when I arrived;
"and that's natural; and that's better." The Archbishop's
and Dean's copes, which were remarkably handsome, were
from James the Second's time; the very same that were worn
at his Coronation, Lord Melbourne told me. Spoke of the
Bishop of Durham's awkwardness, Lord Rolle's fall, etc.
Of the Duc de Nemours being like his father in face; of the
young ladies' (train-bearers') dresses; which he thought beautiful;
and he said he thought the Duchess of Richmond (who
had ordered the make of the dresses, etc., and had been much
condemned by some of the young ladies for it) quite right.
She said to him: "One thing I was determined about; that I
would have no discussion with their Mammas about it."
Spoke of Talleyrand and Soult having been very much struck
by the ceremony of the Coronation; of the English being far
too generous <i>not</i> to be kind to Soult. Lord Melbourne went
home the night before, and slept very deeply till he was woke
at six in the morning. I said I did not sleep well. Spoke of
the Illuminations and Uncle Ernest's wish to see them.</p>

<p class="footnote1">Footnote 22: The King of Hanover.</p>

<p class="ind2" style="margin-top: 1em;">After dinner, before we sat down, we (that is Charles, Lord
Melbourne, and I) spoke of the numbers of Peers at the Coronation,
which, Lord Melbourne said, with the tears in his eyes,
was unprecedented. I observed that there were very few
Viscounts; he said: "There are very few Viscounts," that
they were an odd sort of title and not really English; that
they came from <i>Vice-Comit&eacute;s</i>; that Dukes and Barons were
the only <i>real</i> English titles; that Marquises were likewise not
English; and that they made people Marquises when they
did not wish to make them Dukes. Spoke of Lord Audley
who came as the First Baron, and who Lord Melbourne said
was a very odd young man, but of a very old family; his
ancestor was a Sir Something Audley in the time of the Black
Prince, who, with Chandos, gained the Battle of Poictiers.</p>

<p class="ind2">I then sat on the sofa for a little while with Lady Barham
and then with Charles; Lord Melbourne sitting near me the
whole evening. Mamma and Feodore remained to see the
illuminations and only came in later, and Mamma went away
before I did. Uncle Ernest drove out to see the Illuminations.</p>

<span class="rightnote">PAGES OF HONOUR</span>

<p class="ind2">I said to Lord Melbourne when I first sat down that I felt
a little tired on my feet; "You must be very tired," he said.
Spoke of the weight of the Robes, etc., etc., the Coronets; and
he turned round to me with the tears in his eyes, and said <i>so</i>
kindly: "And you did it beautifully&mdash;every part of it, with
so much taste; it's a thing that you can't give a person advice
upon; it must be left to a person." To hear this, from this
kind impartial friend, gave me great and real pleasure. Mamma
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.125" id="pagei.125"></a>[page&nbsp;125]</span>
and Feodore came back just after he said this. Spoke of the
Bishops' Copes, about which he was very funny; of the Pages
who were such a nice set of boys, and who were so handy,
Lord Melbourne said, that they kept them the whole time.
Little Lord Stafford and Slane (Lord Mountcharles) were pages
to their fathers and looked lovely; Lord Paget (not a fine boy)
was Lord Melbourne's page and remarkably handy, he said.
Spoke again of the young ladies' dresses, about which he was
very amusing; he waited for his carriage with Lady Mary
Talbot and Lady Wilhelmina; he thinks Lady Fanny does
not make as much show as other girls, which I would not allow.
He set off for the Abbey from his house at half-past eight, and
was there long before anybody else; he only got home at half-past
six and had to go round by Kensington. He said there
was a large breakfast in the Jerusalem Chamber where they
met <i>before</i> all began; he said, laughing, that whenever the
Clergy, or a Dean and Chapter, had anything to do with anything,
there's sure to be plen'y to eat.</p>

<p class="ind2">Spoke of my intending to go to bed, etc.; he said, "You may
depend upon it, you are more tired than you think you are." I
said I had slept badly the night before; he said that was my
mind, that nothing kept people more awake than any consciousness
of a great event going to take place, and being
agitated. He was not sure if he was not going to the Duke of
Wellington's.</p>

<p class="ind2">Stayed in the dining room till twenty minutes past eleven,
but remained on Mamma's balcony looking at the fireworks
in Green Park, which were quite beautiful.</p>

<p class="ind2">Uncle Ernest, Charles, Feodore, and the Ladies and Gentlemen
(like Lehzen, etc.) saw me leave the Palace, arrive at the
Abbey, leave the Abbey, and return to the Palace. Got a
long letter from Aunt Louise.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
The very difficult and embarrassing situation in which Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.128" id="pagei.128"></a>[page&nbsp;128]</span>
Durham and the Canadas and the Ministry are left by the vote
of the House of Lords of last night, requires that a Cabinet
should be held to-day, and Lord Melbourne has directed one to
be summoned at two. Lord Melbourne will wait upon your
Majesty either before that hour or after, about four o'clock.
The vote of last night and the Bill of Lord Brougham<sup>24</sup> is a
direct censure upon Lord Durham. Lord Durham's conduct
has been most rash and indiscreet, and, as far as we can see,
unaccountable. But to censure him now would either be to
cause his resignation, which would produce great embarrassment,
and might produce great evil, or to weaken his authority,
which is evidently most undesirable....</p>


<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 24: This Bill (which emphasised the illegality of Lord Durham's ordinance) was read a
second time by 54 to 36. On the following day Lord Melbourne announced to the Peers
that Ministers had resolved to advise that the ordinance should be disallowed.

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My most beloved Victoria</span>,&mdash;I can never thank you enough
for the dear letter which I found on my table on arriving here,
Sunday evening. It was most kind of you to have written so
soon after our departure, and such an affectionate, good, kind
letter. The tears came to my eyes as I read it, and I felt quite
moved. Short as has been our stay, and great, as always, the
pain of leaving you, it has been a <i>great happiness</i> for me to see
you again, a happiness for which I shall always thank God, you,
and your dear Uncle. I need not add how <i>very precious</i> is your
affection to me, and how <i>very grateful</i> I am for every new proof
of it. You know my feelings on this point, and you know they
are better <i>felt</i> than <i>expressed</i>. Your calling me <i>Louise</i>, and
in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.129" id="pagei.129"></a>[page&nbsp;129]</span>

(key), and he wears it suspended to his neck by a blue riband,
with the Duchess's little seal. He felt deeply the attention you
had to have an <i>L</i> engraved on each tool, and after his letter
was closed he charged me to thank you for it, and to tell you
that it gave him great pleasure. An <i>iron spade</i> was the
greatest object of his ambition, and he worked so hard yesterday
with it, that I feared he would hurt himself with the
exertion. He will go to-day to the races with us, in the Scotch
dress which the Duchess had the kindness to send him. It fits
very well, and he is very proud of having a coat shaped <i>like

his willingness, and indeed his desire, to undertake the government
of Canada. It would have been better if Lord Normanby
had acquainted Lord Melbourne quietly of this, and not
made it at once public to all the world. It is not necessary to
do anything at present. If Lord Durham remains, which Lord
Melbourne does not, however, think likely, there will be no
successor to be appointed, and if he returns, the authority of
Governor of Lower Canada will devolve upon Sir John Colborne,<sup>27</sup>

afford to O'Connell a pretext and opportunity for giving up his
new scheme of agitation. It is also added that the Duke would
suffer himself to be guided on all essential matters by the
advice of his Chief Secretary, and that he would content himself
with discharging the ceremonial duties. Here are the reasons

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dear Uncle</span>,&mdash;.... We have all been much distressed
by the melancholy and untimely death of poor Lady
John Russell,<sup>29</sup> which took place on the 1st. She was safely confined
on the 20th of October with a little girl, who bears my
name, and seemed to be going on very well; but on Wednesday
she began to sink from weakness, not disease, and died at
three o'clock on Thursday. It is a dreadful blow to <i>him</i>, for he
was <i>so</i> attached to her, and I don't believe two people ever
were happier together. I send you his pretty letter to me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.131" id="pagei.131"></a>[page&nbsp;131]</span>
which I think you may be interested to see; he is <i>dreadfully</i>
beat down by it, but struggles manfully against his grief,
which makes one pity him more. She has left four children by
her first husband, <i>now orphans</i>, the eldest a sweet girl twelve
years old, and two little girls by Lord John; the eldest of
these two is two and a half, and the youngest a <i>fortnight</i>.
I had known her <i>very</i> well and liked her, and I assure
you I was dreadfully shocked at it. You may also imagine
what a loss she is to poor Miss Lister, who has no mother,
and whose only sister she was. I fear, dear Uncle, I have
made a sad and melancholy letter of this, but I have been so
much engrossed by all this misery, and knowing you take an
interest in poor Lord John, that I let my pen run on almost
involuntarily.</p>

<p class="ind">We have very good accounts of the Queen-Dowager from
Gibraltar.</p>

<p class="ind">Please return me Lord John's letter when you have done
with it.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord and Lady Howard<sup>30</sup> have been here, and I urged him to
<i>bear</i> Dietz as an inevitable evil, and I think he seems very
anxious to do what is right. I have likewise written to
Ferdinand, urging <i>him</i> and Dietz to be reasonable.</p>

<p class="ind">Will you tell Aunt Louise that she will receive a box containing
the Limerick lace dress (just like mine), which I lay at
her feet. I fear, dear Uncle, you will think I'm making you my
commissioner <i>de toilette</i>, as in these two letters I have plagued
you with commissions on that subject....</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Victoria</span>,&mdash;Your kind and interesting letter of
the 6th reached me yesterday morning. I hail in you those
simple and unaffected feelings which it contains. May you
<i>always</i> preserve that great warmth and truth of character
which you now possess, and rest assured that it will be an
ornament to you, and the means of finding the same truth and
warmth of feeling in others. Those who serve, from whatever
motive it may be, have always their eyes wide open on their
superiors, and no qualities impose so much on them the
necessity of respect, which they <i>gladly avoid</i>, than a warm and
noble character that knows how to feel for others, and how to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.132" id="pagei.132"></a>[page&nbsp;132]</span>
sympathise with their sorrows. I pity Lord John from all my
heart, having always had for him sentiments of the sincerest
regard. I fear that as a political man it may prove also a severe
blow. All depends on how he takes it, if he will wish to forget
his grief by occupying himself with political strife or if his
greater sensibility will make him wish to indulge it in solitude....</p>

in and feel for poor Lord John; he is, I hear, still dreadfully
shaken, and quite unequal to do any business at present. His
chief consolation is in attending to the children.</p>

<p class="ind">I felt much for you, and still more for poor dear Aunt
Louise, when the sad separation from poor Marie<sup>31</sup> took place;
it is so melancholy to see a dear relation depart who is <i>so ill</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">I have this morning heard from Ferdinand that the good
Queen is at last confined, after keeping us for <i>two months</i> and
<i>more dans l'attente</i> of the event. It took place on the 3rd,
and Ferdinand writes such a funny letter, saying, "nous
sommes tous bien heureux surtout moi qui craignais que ce
ne f&ucirc;t une petite fille ce qui m'e&ucirc;t &eacute;t&eacute; un peu d&eacute;sagr&eacute;able,

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne fears, from what he hears of the language
of Lord Howick and Mr. Monson, that much difficulty will be
found in making arrangements and deciding upon questions.
But Lord Melbourne will use every effort in his power in order
to keep the Administration together and to carry on the public

service. Lord Melbourne hears with concern from Mr Fox
Maule that Lord John Russell does not return to business as
readily as Mr Maule had hoped that he would, and Lord
Melbourne fears that he will not do whilst he remains at
Cassiobury with the children. Solitude and retirement cherish
and encourage grief. Employment and exertion are the only
means of dissipating it.</p>

<p class="indright"><i>22nd November 1838</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and begs to acknowledge your Majesty's gracious communication
received yesterday. Lord Melbourne had nothing
particular to lay before your Majesty, but still regrets that
he did not write, as your Majesty might have wished to hear
from him.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne returns the King of Portugal's<sup>34</sup> letter,
which, as your Majesty observes, is very rough and ill-tempered
with reference to Lord Howard.<sup>35</sup> Lord Melbourne read it with
much concern, as it shows so much dislike and alienation, as
renders it very improbable that they should ever go on together
well and in a friendly spirit. Lord Melbourne fears that
the epithets applied to Lord Howard, though very severe and
full of resentment, are not entirely ill-chosen and inappropriate.</p>

<p class="ind">All the Ministers, except Lord Duncannon<sup>36</sup> and Lord John
Russell, dined here yesterday, and they all appeared to be in
very good-humour and disposed to co-operate in order to meet
the difficulties by which we are surrounded....</p>

<p class="ind">With respect to Canada, Lord Melbourne feels that it may
be considered somewhat presumptuous in him to undervalue
danger, which is considered by those upon the spot to be so
great and so imminent, but still he cannot feel the alarm which
seems to be felt there. Lord Durham, Lord Melbourne is convinced,
exaggerates the peril in order to give greater <i>&eacute;clat</i> to his
own departure. The worst symptom which Lord Melbourne
perceives is the general fear which seems to prevail there, and
which makes every danger ten times as great as it really is.</p>

as Mr Hill-Trevor from 1830-1841, and, as Viscount Dungannon, was elected in 1843,
but immediately unseated on petition.</p>

England is in an <i>excellent</i> position for a <i>mediator</i>, and for all

affect more or less everybody, and <i>this</i> ought to be the object
of our most anxious attention. I remain, my dear Victoria,

Leopold on the throne.</p>

<p class="footnote1">Footnote 38: King Leopold considered that the interests of Belgium were being neglected by the
four Powers, and in his speech at the opening of his Parliament, on 13th November,
stated amid loud acclamations that those interests would be defended with perseverance
and courage. The Deputies, in reply, said that Belgium had consented to painful sacrifices
only under a formal guarantee by the Powers, which they now shrank from carrying
out.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.135" id="pagei.135"></a>[page&nbsp;135]</span>
it right to acquaint the King that your Majesty had already
seen his letter to Lord Palmerston.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne cannot perceive the justice of the King's
complaint. For the sake of the King himself and of the
Belgian nation, we are most anxious to settle speedily and
definitely the questions so long pending between Belgium and
Holland, and which arose from the separation of the two
countries in 1830. We can only settle it by the agreement of
the four Great Powers who constitute the Conference to which
the question was referred, viz., Austria, Prussia, England,
France. Of course it is of vital importance for us to carry them
all along with us, and for that reason we press France. If she
differs from us, there is a ground immediately laid for difference
and war.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne would suggest that your Majesty should
say "that your great affection for the King, as well as your
anxiety for the interests of your own country, and your desire
for the promotion of peace, render you most solicitous to have
the Belgian question speedily and definitively settled; that it
appears to you that it can only be settled by the agreement of

therefore you cannot but wish most strongly to carry France
as well as the two others along with you."<sup>39</sup></p>

but much hurt and vexed at the last despatch which expresses
your Majesty's disapprobation of his conduct in issuing the

write an answer to it, in which he should state that he would
communicate to the Government all the information which he
had collected upon the state of the Canadas. That he should not

He may alter it; if he should, and through any channel

that your Majesty should merely say that an answer will be
sent and the propriety of granting an audience may then be

which I feel most anxious. It is the want of a <i>Protestant church</i>
in this place which I mean. There are so many English residents
here, it is the seat of an English Government, and there
is <i>not one</i> church belonging to the Church of England....
The consequence of this want of church accommodation has
been that the Dissenters have established themselves in considerable
numbers, and one cannot blame persons for attending
their meetings when they have no church of their own.</p>

<p class="ind">I address myself to you, as the head of the Church of England,
and entreat you to consider well this important subject,
and to talk it over with your Ministers and the Archbishop, in
order to devise the best means of remedying a want so discreditable
to our country. Should there be no funds at your
disposal to effect this object, most happy shall I feel to contribute
to any subscription which may be set on foot, and I
believe that a considerable sum may be raised amongst the
Protestants of this island, where all parties are most anxious
to see a proper place of divine worship erected; without
assistance from England, however, it cannot be effected. I
therefore most humbly and confidently submit this subject to
you, dearest Victoria, who will bestow upon your Protestant
subjects of this island an everlasting benefit by granting them
what they want most.<sup>44</sup>...</p>

require his presence for two or three days longer in London.
The session of Parliament approaches; the questions which
are to be considered and prepared are of the most appalling
magnitude, and of the greatest difficulty. Many of your

compelled by domestic calamity to be absent, and it is absolutely

<h3  style="margin-top: 5em;">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>

<h3 style="margin-top: -0.5em;">TO CHAPTER VIII</h3>


<p><span class="sc">The</span> chief political event of the year (1839) at home arose out of
the troubles in Jamaica. In addition to the apprenticeship question,
the state of the prisons, much overcrowded owing to the planters'
severity, had excited attention, and an Imperial Act was passed for
their regulation. To this action the Colonial Assembly showed
marked hostility, and, after the dissolution by Sir Lionel Smith, the
Governor, the new House was no more placable. Accordingly, the
home Government brought in a Bill, in April, to suspend temporarily
the Jamaica Constitution, but on a division had a majority of five
only in a house of five hundred and eighty-three. The Ministers
therefore resigned, and Sir Robert Peel was sent for; a difficulty as
to the Ladies of the Household, commonly called the Bedchamber
Plot, compelled him to resign the task, and the Whigs, much injured
in reputation, resumed office. Some changes took place, Macaulay
joining the Ministry, and Lord Normanby, who had succeeded Lord
Glenelg at the Colonial Office, exchanging places with Lord John
Russell, the Home Secretary. The trial of strength over the Speakership
ended in a victory for the Ministerial candidate, Mr Shaw
Lefevre, by a majority of eighteen in a house of six hundred and
sixteen.</p>

<p>Penny Postage was introduced by an Act of this session.</p>

<p>The Princes Ernest and Albert of Saxe-Coburg arrived on a visit
to the Queen in October, and on the 14th the Queen's engagement to
the latter was announced by herself to Lord Melbourne. A few weeks
later the Queen announced her betrothal at a meeting of the Privy
Council.</p>

<p>During the year risings in favour of the "people's charter" took
place in various parts of the country, especially Birmingham and
Newport, the six points demanded being the ballot, universal suffrage,
annual Parliaments, payment of members, the abolition of a property
qualification for members, and equal electoral districts. At Newport
one Frost, a linen-draper whom Lord John Russell had made a
magistrate, headed a riot. He was tried with his confederates by a
special commission at Monmouth, and, with two others, sentenced
to death; a sentence afterwards commuted.</p>

<p>In the East, war broke out between the Sultan Mahmoud and the
Pasha of Egypt, Mehemet Ali, who had originally helped Turkey
against Greece, but had since revolted and driven the Turks from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.142" id="pagei.142"></a>[page&nbsp;142]</span>
Syria. On that occasion (1833) Turkey had been saved by Russian
intervention, a defensive alliance, known as the treaty of Unkiar
Skelessi, made between Russia and Turkey, and Mehemet granted
Syria as well as Egypt. On the revival of hostilities, Ibrahim, son of
Mehemet, defeated the Turkish army on June 24; a week later the
Sultan Mahmoud died, and the Turkish admiral treacherously delivered
over the Turkish fleet to Mehemet at Alexandria. Once more
the four Powers (Great Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia) interfered
to save the Sultan. The Czar accepted the principle of a joint
mediation, the advance of the Egyptians was stopped, and the Sultan
was informed that no terms of peace would be accepted which had not
received the approval of the Powers. The terms were settled at a
congress held in London. Mehemet refused to accept the terms, and
was encouraged by France to persevere in his refusal.</p>

<p>The dispute between Belgium and Holland as to the Luxemburg
territory was settled by a treaty in the course of the year. Lord
Durham presented his report on Canada, a document drafted by
Charles Buller but inspired by Lord Durham himself; though
legislation did not take place this year, this document laid the foundation
of the federal union of the Canadas, and of the Constitution
of other autonomous colonies, but for the present the ex-Commissioner
met with much criticism of his actions.</p>

<p>Our troops were engaged during the year against Dost Mahommed,
the Ameer of Afghanistan, a usurper who many years earlier had
driven Shah Sooja into exile. Lord Auckland, the Viceroy of India,
had sent Captain (afterwards Sir Alexander) Burnes on a Mission to
Cabul, and the Ameer had received him hospitably at first, but subsequently
dismissed him from his Court. Lord Auckland thereupon
resolved to restore Shah Sooja, and in the autumn of 1838 issued a
manifesto dethroning Dost Mahommed. Operations were accordingly
directed against him under Sir John (afterwards Lord) Keane,
who, on August 6, 1839, entered Cabul and placed Shah Sooja on the
throne. However open to criticism, the news of this result was
enthusiastically received in England, and Lord Auckland was promoted
to an Earldom.</p>

<p>In China a dispute of long standing became acute. With the
renewal of the East India Company's charter, in 1834, the Chinese
ports had been thrown open, and the opium trade became a source
of great profit to private traders. In spite of the prohibition
which the Chinese Government laid on importation of opium,
the traffic was actively carried on, and, as a result of the strained
relations which ensued, Captain Elliot, the British Chief Superintendent,
requested that warships should proceed to China for the
protection of British life and property.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.144" id="pagei.144"></a>[page&nbsp;144]</span>
gracious communication which he had the honour and pleasure
of receiving from your Majesty yesterday evening. Your
Majesty will have seen in the newspapers that Lord Norbury
was shot at in his own grounds and dangerously wounded.<sup>5</sup>
Lord Melbourne learns to-day by a letter from Lord Morpeth
that Lord Norbury is since dead. This is a shocking event,
and will, of course, create a strong sensation, much stronger
than the death in the same manner of several persons of inferior
degree. It is almost the first time that an attempt of this
kind has been directed against an individual of that rank or
station....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne has seen Sir Henry Halford,<sup>6</sup> who says that
his pulse is low and his system languid. He has prescribed
some draughts, which Lord Melbourne trusts will be of service,
but he feels much depressed to-day. He dined yesterday at
Lady Holland's, where he met Mr Ellice,<sup>7</sup> civil and friendly
enough in appearance, but Lord Melbourne fears hostile at
heart, and a determined partisan of Lord Durham. Lord
Durham has not yet made to Lord Glenelg the promised communication
of his report and plan, but it is said that he will do
so soon....</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and returns to your Majesty the accompanying papers
which he received from Viscount Melbourne. Your Majesty
will have seen by Sir Edward Disbrowe's<sup>9</sup> despatches that the
concentration of Dutch troops mentioned in these reports was
purely defensive, and was the consequence of the military
demonstrations previously made by the Belgians; and it
appears, moreover, that the Dutch force is inferior in number
to the Belgian force opposite to it; and that affords an additional
security against the chance of an invasion of Belgium
by the Dutch. It is, however, undeniable that when two
armies are drawn up in face of each other, separated by a small
distance, and animated by mutual hatred, the chances of
collision become great and imminent. But it is to be hoped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.146" id="pagei.146"></a>[page&nbsp;146]</span>

Dutch have so instantly accepted the proposition of the Conference,
Belgium would suffer in the eyes of this country were

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and thinks it right and necessary to acquaint your Majesty
that the Cabinet yesterday was very stormy and unpleasant.
Lord John Russell brought on the question of the Civil Government
of the Army, in a temperate and judicious manner, but
Lord Howick made a most violent speech, strongly condemning
the whole of the present system and arraigning the conduct of
the Treasury and other Departments, saying that he should
not throw up his office because no measure was brought forward,
but that, when questioned upon the subject by Mr Hume
in the House of Commons, as it was certain that he would be,
he should say that Government would do nothing upon the
subject, until he (Mr Hume) compelled them, and that he should
express his entire disapprobation of the present system, and
his reasons in detail for that disapprobation. Your Majesty
will perceive that nothing could be more violent than this
course. It was borne with great patience by the rest of the
Cabinet, although Mr. Rice,<sup>14</sup> against whom the greater part of
Lord Howick's speech was directed, felt himself most deeply
hurt, and so expressed himself in private afterwards to Lord
Melbourne. Upon the whole, Lord Melbourne cannot but consider
that affairs are in a most precarious state, and that whilst
there is so much discontent fermenting within the Cabinet itself,
there must be great doubt of Lord Melbourne's being much
longer able to hold the Administration together.</p>

Caroline sojourned for some time. We were particularly fortunate
that day, as the brightest sunshine heightened its picturesque

full, and to see it and its ecclesiastic governors to advantage,
the Holy Week is certainly the properest time. From morning

dear Majesty, very <i>kindly</i> and <i>nicely</i> expressed. I know that
your generous little heart would not have wished at any time
but what was good for a country in which you were <i>much
beloved</i>. But the fact is, that certainly your Government have
taken the lead in maintaining a condition which time had
rendered difficult to comply with. Physicians will tell you
that often an operation, which might have been performed at
one time, could not, without great danger for the patient, be
undertaken some years later. We have not been listened to,
and arrangements <i>are forced</i> on us, in themselves full of
seeds of danger, when by consulting the <i>real interests</i> of Holland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.153" id="pagei.153"></a>[page&nbsp;153]</span>
and Belgium, both countries might have been placed on a footing
of <i>sincere peace</i> and good neighbourhood. This country
feels now humbled and <i>d&eacute;senchant&eacute;</i> with its <i>soi-disant</i> political
independence as it pleased the Conference to settle it. They
will take a dislike to a political state which <i>wounds their vanity</i>,
and will, in consequence of this, <i>not wish it to continue</i>. Two
things will happen, therefore, on the very first opportunity,
either that this country will be involved in war to better a
position which it thinks <i>too humiliating</i>, or that it will voluntarily
throw up a nominal independence in which it is now
hemmed in between France and Holland, which begins on the
North Sea, and ends, of all the things in this world, on <i>the
Moselle</i>!</p>

<p class="ind">I think old Pirson, who said in the Chamber that if the
treaty was carried into execution I was likely to be the first
and last King of the country, was not wrong. Whenever this
will happen, it will be <i>very awkward</i> for England, and <i>deservedly
so</i>. To see, after eight years of hard work, blooming and
thriving political plantations cut and maimed, and that by
those who have a real interest to protect them, is very melancholy.
I do not say these things with the most distant idea
of bringing about any change, but only because in the high and
very responsible position in which Providence has placed you,
it is good to tell you the truth, as you ought to have weight and
influence on the affairs of Europe; and England, not being in
the possibility of making territorial acquisition, has a real and
permanent interest in the proper maintenance of a balance of
political power in Europe. Now I will leave you to enjoy the
beginning of Spring, which a mild rain seems to push on prodigiously.

<span class="rightnote">MINISTERIAL CRISIS</span>

<p class="indright"><i>7th May 1839</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and has to acquaint your Majesty that the division upon the
Jamaica Bill, which took place about two this morning, was two
hundred and ninety-nine against the measure, and three hundred
and four in favour of it.<sup>30</sup> Lord Melbourne has not heard
from Lord John Russell since this event, but a Cabinet will of
course be summoned early this morning, and Lord Melbourne
cannot conceal from your Majesty that in his opinion the determination
of the Cabinet must be that the relative numbers
upon this vote, joined to the consideration of no less than nine
members of those who have hitherto invariably supported the
Government having gone against it now, leave your Majesty's
confidential servants no alternative but to resign their offices
into your Majesty's hands. They cannot give up the Bill either
with honour or satisfaction to their own consciences, and in the
face of such an opposition they cannot persevere in it with any
hope of success. Lord Melbourne is certain that your Majesty
will not deem him too presuming if he expresses his fear that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.155" id="pagei.155"></a>[page&nbsp;155]</span>
this decision will be both painful and embarrassing to your
Majesty, but your Majesty will meet this crisis with that
firmness which belongs to your character, and with that rectitude
and sincerity which will carry your Majesty through all
difficulties. It will also be greatly painful to Lord Melbourne
to quit the service of a Mistress who has treated him with such
unvarying kindness and unlimited confidence; but in whatever
station he may be placed, he will always feel the deepest anxiety
for your Majesty's interests and happiness, and will do the
utmost in his power to promote and secure them.</p>


<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 30: The numbers are apparently incorrectly stated. The division was 294 to 289.</p>


<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">RESIGNATION IMMINENT</span>

<p class="indright"><i>7th May 1839</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The present circumstances have been for some time so probable,
or rather so certain, that Lord Melbourne has naturally been
led to weigh and consider maturely the advice which, if called
upon, he should tender to your Majesty when they did arrive.
That advice is, at once to send for the Duke of Wellington.
Your Majesty appears to Lord Melbourne to have no other
alternative. The Radicals have neither ability, honesty, nor
numbers. They have no leaders of any character. Lord
Durham was raised, one hardly knows how, into something of
a factitious importance by his own extreme opinions, by the
panegyrics of those who thought he would serve them as an
instrument, and by the management of the Press, but any little
public reputation which he might once have acquired has been
entirely dissipated and destroyed by the continued folly of his
conduct in his Canadian Government. There is no party in the
State to which your Majesty can now resort, except that great
party which calls itself Conservative, and of that party, his
rank, station, reputation, and experience point out the Duke of
Wellington as the person to whom your Majesty should apply.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne therefore advises that your Majesty should
send for the Duke of Wellington, and should acquaint him, provided
your Majesty so feels, that you were entirely satisfied with
your late Government, and that you part from them with reluctance;
but that as he and the party of which he is the head
have been the means of removing them from office, you naturally
look to him to advise you as to the means of supplying
their places and carrying on the business of the country.</p>

<p class="ind">If the Duke should be unwilling to form the Government
himself, and should desire to devolve the task upon Sir Robert
Peel, Lord Melbourne would advise your Majesty to accede to
that suggestion; but Lord Melbourne would counsel your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.156" id="pagei.156"></a>[page&nbsp;156]</span>
Majesty to be very unwilling to suffer the Government to be
formed by Sir Robert Peel, without the active assistance in
office of the Duke of Wellington.</p>

<p class="ind">With respect both to measures and appointments, your
Majesty should place the fullest confidence in those to whom
you entrust the management of affairs, exercising at the same
time, and fully expressing, your own judgment upon both.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty will do well to be from the beginning very
vigilant that all measures and all appointments are stated to
your Majesty in the first instance, and your Majesty's pleasure
taken thereon previously to any instruments being drawn out
for carrying them into effect, and submitted to your Majesty's
signature. It is the more necessary to be watchful and active
in this respect, as the extreme confidence which your Majesty
has reposed in me may have led to some omission at times of
these most necessary preliminaries.</p>

<p class="ind">The patronage of the Lord Chamberlain's Department is of
the greatest importance, and may be made to conduce at once
to the beneficial influence of the Crown, and to the elevation
and encouragement of the professions of the Church and of
Medicine. This patronage, by being left to the uncontrolled
exercise of successive Lord Chamberlains, has been administered
not only wastefully but perniciously. The physicians
to the late King were many of them men of little eminence;
the chaplains are still a sorry set. Your Majesty should insist
with the new Ministers that this patronage should be disposed
of, not by the Lord Chamberlain, but, as it has hitherto
been during your Majesty's reign, by your Majesty upon consultation
with your Prime Minister.</p>



<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">DISTRESS OF THE QUEEN</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>9th May 1839</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen thinks Lord Melbourne may possibly wish to
know how she is this morning; the Queen is somewhat calmer;
she was in a wretched state till nine o'clock last night, when she
tried to occupy herself and try to think less gloomily of this
dreadful change, and she succeeded in calming herself till she
went to bed at twelve, and she slept well; but on waking this
morning, all&mdash;all that had happened in one short eventful day
came most forcibly to her mind, and brought back her grief;
the Queen, however, feels better now; but she couldn't touch
a morsel of food last night, nor can she this morning. The
Queen trusts Lord Melbourne slept well, and is well this morning;
and that he will come precisely at eleven o'clock. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.157" id="pagei.157"></a>[page&nbsp;157]</span>
Queen has received no answer from the Duke, which is very
odd, for she knows he got her letter. The Queen hopes Lord
Melbourne received her letter last night.</p>




<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><i>8th May 1839</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and is much grieved that he did not answer your Majesty's
letter yesterday evening, as your Majesty desired, but he did
not get it till late, and he felt much tired and harassed by all
that had passed during the day. The situation is very painful,
but it is necessary for your Majesty to be prudent and firm.
It is of all things necessary not to be suspected of any unfair
dealing. Whilst Lord Melbourne holds his office, everything
of course may be written to him as usual; but still the resolutions
for the formation of the new Government will now commence,
and it will never do, whilst they are going on, either for
appearance or in reality, that Lord Melbourne should dine with
your Majesty, as he did before this disturbance. It would
create feeling, possibly lead to remonstrance, and throw a
doubt upon the fairness and integrity of your Majesty's conduct.
All this is very painful both to do and to say, but it is
unavoidable; it must be said, and it must be done. Lord
Melbourne will wait upon your Majesty at eleven.<sup>31</sup></p>


<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 31: Lord Melbourne had made the not unnatural mistake of recommending to the Queen,
as members of her first Household, ladies who were nearly related to himself and his Whig
colleagues. No doubt these were the ladies whom he knew best, and in whom he had
entire confidence; but he ought to have had sufficient prescience to see that the Queen
would probably form strong attachments to the ladies who first served her: and that
if the appointments had not in the first instance a political complexion, yet that the Whig
tendencies which these Ladies represented were likely to affect the Queen, in the direction
of allying her closely with a particular party in the State.

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to Viscount Melbourne.</i></h5>


<span class="rightnote">THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON</span>

<p class="indright"><i>8th May 1839</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen told Lord Melbourne she would give him an
account of what passed, which she is <i>very</i> anxious to do. She
saw the Duke for about twenty minutes; the Queen said she
supposed he knew why she sent for him, upon which the Duke
said, No, he had no idea. The Queen then said that she had
had the greatest confidence in her late Ministry, and had parted
with them with the greatest reluctance; upon which the Duke
observed that he could assure me no one felt more pain in hearing
the announcement of their resignation than he did, and
that he was deeply grieved at it. The Queen then continued,
that as his party had been instrumental in removing them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.158" id="pagei.158"></a>[page&nbsp;158]</span>
that she must look to him to form a new Government. The
Duke answered that he had no power whatever in the House
of Commons, "that if he was to say black was white,<sup>32</sup> they
would say it was not," and that he advised me to send for Sir
Robert Peel, in whom I could place confidence, and who was
a gentleman and a man of honour and integrity. The Queen
then said she hoped he would at all events have a place in the
new Cabinet. The Duke at first rather refused, and said he
was so deaf, and so old and unfit for any discussion, that if he
were to consult his own feelings he would rather not do it, and
remain quite aloof; but that as he was very anxious to do
anything that would tend to the Queen's comfort, and would
do everything and at all times that could be of use to the
Queen, and therefore if she and her Prime Minister urged his
accepting office, he would. The Queen said she had more confidence
in him than in any of the others of his party. The
Queen then mentioned the subject of the Household, and of
those who were not in Parliament. The Duke did not give any
decisive answer about it, but advised the Queen not to begin
with conditions of this sort, and wait till the matter was proposed.
The Queen then said that she felt certain he would
understand the great friendship she had for Lord Melbourne,
who had been to her quite a parent, and the Duke said <i>no one
felt and knew that better than he did, and that no one could still be
of greater use to the Queen than Lord Melbourne</i>. The Duke
spoke of his personal friendship for Lord Melbourne, and that
he hoped I knew that he had often done all he could to help
your (Lord Melbourne's) Government. The Queen then mentioned
her intention to prove her great <i>fairness</i> to her new
Government in telling them, that they might know there was
no unfair dealing, that I meant to see you often as a friend, as
I owed <i>so</i> much to you. The Duke said he quite understood it,
and knew I would not exercise this to weaken the Government,
and that he would take my part about it, and felt for me.
He was very kind, and said he called it "a misfortune" that
you had all left me.</p>
<span class="rightnote">SIR ROBERT PEEL</span>
<p class="ind">The Queen wrote to Peel, who came after two, embarrassed
and put out. The Queen repeated what she had said to the
Duke about her former Government, and asked Sir Robert to
form a new Ministry. He does not seem sanguine; says entering
the Government in a minority is very difficult; he felt
unequal to the task, and far from exulting in what had happened,
as he knew what pain it must give me; he quite approved
that the Duke should take office, and saw the importance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.159" id="pagei.159"></a>[page&nbsp;159]</span>
of it; meant to offer him the post of Secretary for Foreign
Affairs, and if he refused, Lord Aberdeen; Lord Lyndhurst,
Chancellor; hoped to secure Stanley and Graham; Goulburn
to be the candidate for the Speaker's Chair; he expects a
severe conflict then, and if he should be beat must either resign
or dissolve Parliament. Before this the Queen said she
was against a dissolution, in which he quite agreed, but of
course wished no conditions should be made; he felt the task
arduous, and that he would require me to demonstrate (<i>a certain</i>
degree, if <i>any</i> I can only feel) confidence in the Government,
and that my Household would be one of the marks of
that. The Queen mentioned the same thing about her Household,
to which he at present would give no answer, and said
nothing should be done without my knowledge or approbation.
He repeated his surprise at the course you had all taken in
resigning, which he did not expect. The Queen talked of her
great friendship for, and gratitude to Lord Melbourne, and repeated
what she had said to the Duke, in which Peel agreed;
but he is such a cold, odd man she can't make out what he
means. He said he couldn't expect me to have the confidence
in him I had in you (and which he never can have) as he has
not deserved it. My impression is, he is not <i>happy</i> and
sanguine. He comes to me to-morrow at one to report progress
in his formation of the new Government. The Queen
don't like his manner after&mdash;oh! how different, how dreadfully
different, to that frank, open, natural and most kind,
warm manner of Lord Melbourne.<sup>33</sup> The Duke I like by far
better to Peel. The Queen trusts Lord Melbourne will excuse
this long letter, but she was so very anxious he should know all.
The Queen was very much collected, and betrayed no agitation
during these two trying Audiences. But afterwards again
<i>all</i> gave way. She feels Lord Melbourne will understand it,
amongst enemies to those she most relied on and esteemed, and
people who seem to have no heart; but what is worst of all is
the being deprived of seeing Lord Melbourne as she used to do.</p>

respect to him (Lord Melbourne) and to themselves and their
own feelings and position, they expressed what they really
think. The Duke was right in saying that in general, in affairs
of this nature, it is best not to begin with conditions; but this
matter of the Household is so personal to yourself, that it was
best to give an intimation of your feelings upon it in the first
instance. Lord Melbourne has little doubt that if they could
have acted from themselves, they would have acceded to
your Majesty's wish at once; but your Majesty must recollect
that they have others to satisfy, and must not attribute entirely
to them anything that is harsh and unreasonable.
Lord Melbourne advises your Majesty to urge this question of
the Household strongly as a matter due to yourself and your
own wishes; but if Sir Robert is unable to concede it, it will
not do to refuse and to put off the negotiation upon it. Lord
Melbourne would strongly advise your Majesty to do everything
to facilitate the formation of the Government. Everything
is to be done and to be endured rather than run the risk
of getting into the situation in which they are in France, of no
party being able to form a Government and conduct the affairs
of the country.<sup>34</sup></p>

<p class="ind">The Dissolution of Parliament is a matter of still more importance,
and if this should be again pressed upon your
Majesty, Lord Melbourne would advise your Majesty to reserve
your opinion, not to give a promise that you will dissolve, nor
to say positively that you will not. You may say that you do
not think it right to fetter the Prerogative of the Crown by
previous engagements, that a dissolution of Parliament is to
be decided according to the circumstances at the time, that you
mean to give full confidence to the Government that shall be
formed, and to do everything in your power to support them,
and that you will consider whether Parliament shall be dissolved,
when you are advised to dissolve it, and have before
you the reasons for such a measure.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne earnestly entreats your Majesty not to
suffer yourself to be affected by any faultiness of manner which
you may observe. Depend upon it, there is no personal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.161" id="pagei.161"></a>[page&nbsp;161]</span>
hostility to Lord Melbourne nor any bitter feelings against
him. Sir Robert is the most cautious and reserved of mankind.
Nobody seems to Lord Melbourne to know him, but
he is not therefore deceitful or dishonest. Many a very false
man has a very open sincere manner, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>....</p>

a man so frightened. He said he must go to the Duke of
Wellington and consult with him, when both would return,
and he said this must suspend all further proceedings, and he
asked whether I should be ready to receive a decision, which
I said I should; he was quite perturbed&mdash;but this is <i>infamous</i>.
I said, besides many other things, that if he or the Duke of

more Tory Ladies, but that then if you had come into Office
you would never have <i>dreamt</i> of changing them. I was calm

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord Melbourne's letter. Lord
Melbourne will since have heard what has taken place. Lord
Melbourne must not think the Queen rash in her conduct; she
saw both the Duke and Sir Robert again, and declared to them
she could not change her opinion. The Ladies are not (as the
Duke imagined was stated in the Civil List Bill) in the <i>place</i>
of the Lords; and the Queen felt this was an attempt to see
whether she could be led and managed like a child; if it should
lead to Sir Robert Peel's refusing to undertake the formation
of the Government, which would be absurd, the Queen will feel
satisfied that she has only been defending her own rights, on a
point which so nearly concerned her person, and which, if they
had succeeded in, would have led to every sort of unfair
attempt at power; the Queen maintains <i>all</i> her ladies,&mdash;and
thinks her Prime Minister will cut a sorry figure indeed if he
resigns on this. Sir Robert is gone to consult with his friends,
and will return in two or three hours with his decision. The
Queen also maintained the Mistress of the Robes, for as he said

like to know if they mean to give the <i>Ladies</i> seats in Parliament?</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE CRISIS</span>

<p class="indright"><i>9th May 1839</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
Lord Melbourne had certainly never expected that this demand
would be urged, and therefore had never advised your Majesty
as to what was to be done in such a case. Lord Melbourne
strongly advises your Majesty to hear what the Duke of Wellington
and Sir Robert Peel urge, but to take time before you
come to a peremptory and final decision.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
This is a matter of so much importance, and may have such
grave results, that any advice which Lord Melbourne could
give would be of little importance unless it coincided with the
opinions of others, and particularly of all those who were and
intend still [to] continue to be his colleagues.</p>

<p class="ind">It will depend upon their determination whether your
Majesty is to be supported or not. The best course will perhaps
be that you should hear Sir Robert Peel's determination,
say nothing, but send for Lord Melbourne, and lay the matter
before him. Lord Melbourne will then summon a Cabinet to
consider of it.</p>



<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Extract from the Queen's Journal.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">THE LADIES OF THE BEDCHAMBER</span>

<p class="indright"><i>9th May 1839</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">At half-past six came Lord Melbourne and stayed with me
till ten minutes past seven.</p>

<p class="ind2">I then began by giving him a detailed account of the whole
proceeding, which I shall state here as briefly as possible. I
first again related what took place in the two first interviews,
and when I said that the Duke said he had assisted my Government
often very much, Lord Melbourne said: "Well, that is
true enough, but the Duke did all he could about this vote."
"Well, then," I said, "when Sir Robert Peel came this morning,
he began first about the Ministry. I consented, though I
said I might have my personal feelings about Lord Lyndhurst
and Lord Aberdeen, but that I would suppress every personal
feeling and be quite fair. I then repeated that I wished to
retain about me those who were not in Parliament, and Sir
Robert <i>pretended</i> that I had the preceding day expressed a wish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.165" id="pagei.165"></a>[page&nbsp;165]</span>
to keep about me those who <i>were</i> in Parliament. I mentioned
my wish to have Lord Liverpool, to which Sir Robert readily
acceded, saying he would offer him the place of Lord Steward,
or of Lord in Waiting. He then suggested my having Lord
Ashley,<sup>36</sup> which I said I should like, as Treasurer or Comptroller.<span class="rightnote">THE LADIES</span>
Soon after this Sir Robert said: 'Now, about the
Ladies,' upon which I said I could <i>not</i> give up <i>any</i> of my Ladies,
and never had imagined such a thing. He asked if I meant to
retain <i>all</i>. '<i>All</i>,' I said. 'The Mistress of the Robes and the
Ladies of the Bedchamber?' I replied, '<i>All</i>,'&mdash;for he said they
were the wives of the opponents of the Government, mentioning
Lady Normanby<sup>37</sup> in particular as one of the late Ministers'
wives. I said that would not interfere; that I never talked
politics with them, and that they were related, many of them, to
Tories, and I enumerated those of my Bedchamber women and
Maids of Honour; upon which he said he did not mean <i>all</i> the
Bedchamber women and <i>all</i> the Maids of Honour, he meant the
Mistress of the Robes and the Ladies of the Bedchamber; to
which I replied <i>they</i> were of more consequence than the others,
and that I could <i>not</i> consent, and that it had never been done
before. He said I was a Queen Regnant, and that made the
difference. 'Not here,' I said&mdash;and I maintained my right.
Sir Robert then urged it upon <i>public grounds only</i>, but I said
here I could not consent. He then begged to be allowed to
consult with the Duke upon such an important matter. I expressed
a wish also to see the Duke, if Sir Robert approved,
which he said he did, and that he would return with the Duke,
if I would then be prepared for the decision, which I said I
would. Well," I continued, "the Duke and Sir Robert returned
soon, and I first saw the Duke, who talked first of his
being ready to take the post of Secretary for Foreign Affairs,
which I had pressed Peel to urge on him (the Duke having first
wished to be in the Cabinet, without accepting office), and the
Duke said, 'I am able to do anything,' for I asked him if it
would not be too much for him. Then I told him that I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.166" id="pagei.166"></a>[page&nbsp;166]</span>
been very well satisfied with Sir Robert yesterday, and asked
the Duke if Sir Robert had told him what had passed about the
Ladies. He said he had, and then I repeated all my arguments,
and the Duke his; but the Duke and Sir Robert differed
considerably on two points. The Duke said the <i>opinions</i> of
the Ladies were nothing, but it was the <i>principle</i>, whether the
Minister could remove the Ladies or not, and that he (the Duke)
had understood it was stated in the Civil List Bill, 'that the
<i>Ladies were instead of the Lords</i>,' which is quite false, and I told
the Duke that there were not <i>twelve Lords</i>, as the expense <i>with
the Ladies</i> would have been too great." Lord Melbourne said:
"There you had the better of him, and what did he say?"
"Not much," I replied. I repeated many of my arguments, all
which pleased Lord Melbourne, and which he agreed to,
amongst others, that I said to the Duke, Was Sir Robert so
weak that <i>even</i> the Ladies must be of his opinion? The Duke
denied that. The Duke then took my decision to Sir Robert,
who was waiting in the next room; after a few minutes Sir
Robert returned. After stopping a few minutes, as I have
already stated, Sir Robert went to see his colleagues, and
returned at five: said he had consulted with those who were
to have been his colleagues, and that they agreed that, with the
probability of being beat the first night about the Speaker, and
beginning with a Minority in the House of Commons, that
unless there was <i>some</i> (<i>all</i> the Officers of State and Lords I gave
up) demonstration of my confidence, and if I retained all my
Ladies this would not be, "they agreed unanimously they
could not go on." I replied I would reflect, that I felt certain
I should not change my mind, but that I should do nothing in
a hurry, and would write him my decision either that evening
or the next morning. He said, meanwhile, he would suspend
all further proceedings.</p>


<p class="footnote1">Footnote 36: Afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury, the well-known Philanthropist.</p>

<p class="footnote1">Footnote 37: J. W. Croker wrote to the King of Hanover:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indrightnote" style="margin-top: -1.5em;">"<i>11th May 1839.</i></p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: -1em;">"... This is the sum of the whole affair. Sir R. Peel could not admit that broad
principle that all were to remain. Lady Normanby (whom the Queen particularly wishes
for), for instance, the wife of the very Minister whose measures have been the cause of
the change, two sisters of Lord Morpeth, the sisters-in-law of Lord John Russell, the
daughter of the Privy Seal and the Chancellor of the Exchequer....</p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: -0.5em;">"Her Majesty's ball last night was, I am told, rather dull, though she herself seemed
in high spirits, as if she were pleased at retaining her Ministers. She has a great concert
on the 13th, but to both, as I hear, the invitations have been on a very exclusive principle,
no Tories being invited who could on any pretence be left out. These are small matters,
but everything tends to create a public impression that Her Majesty takes a personal and
strong interest in the Whigs&mdash;a new ingredient of difficulty."&mdash;<i>Croker Papers</i>, II. 347.
</p>

<p class="ind2" style="margin-top: 1em;">I also told Lord Melbourne that I feared I had embarrassed
the Government; that I acted quite alone. Lord Melbourne
saw, and said I could not do otherwise. "I must summon the
Cabinet," said Lord Melbourne, at half-past nine. "It may
have very serious consequences. If we can't go on with this
House of Commons, we may have to dissolve Parliament,
and we don't know if we may get as good a House of Commons."
I begged him to come, and he said: "I'll come if
it is in any time&mdash;if it's twelve; but if it's one or two, I'll
write."</p>

<p class="ind2">After dinner (as usual with the Household) I went to my
room, and sat up till a quarter past two. At a quarter to two
I received the following letter from Lord Melbourne, written at
one o'clock:&mdash;</p>

advises your Majesty to return the following answer to Sir

into her hands, they could tender no advice.... The Cabinet of Lord Melbourne
discussed the proposals of that of Sir Robert Peel, and they dictated to the Queen the

she will receive none, as Sir Robert told the Queen if the
Ladies were not removed, his party would fall directly, and
could not go on, and that he only awaited the Queen's decision.
The Queen therefore wishes to see Lord Melbourne about half-past
twelve or one, if that would do.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen fears Lord Melbourne has much trouble in consequence
of all this; but the Queen was fully prepared, and
fully intended to give these people a fair trial, though she always

which is somewhat of a fatigue for to-night when the Queen
must be very late. Really all these F&ecirc;tes in the midst of such

would be any harm in her writing to the Duke of Cambridge
that she really was fearful of fatiguing herself, if she went out
to a party at Gloucester House on Tuesday, an Ancient Concert
on Wednesday, and a ball at Northumberland House on
Thursday, considering how much she had to do these last four
days. If she went to the Ancient Concert on Wednesday,
having besides a concert of her own here on Monday, it would
be four nights of fatigue, really exhausted as the Queen is.</p>

<p class="ind">But if Lord Melbourne thinks that as there are only to be
English singers at the Ancient Concert, she ought to go, she
could go there for one act; but she would much rather, if
possible, get out of it, for it is a fatiguing time....</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and has had the honour of receiving your Majesty's note of this
morning.</p>

<p class="ind">In respectfully submitting to your Majesty's pleasure, and
humbly returning into your Majesty's hands the important
trust which your Majesty had been graciously pleased to commit
to him, Sir Robert Peel trusts that your Majesty will permit
him to state to your Majesty his impression with respect to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.169" id="pagei.169"></a>[page&nbsp;169]</span>
circumstances which have led to the termination of his attempt
to form an Administration for the conduct of your Majesty's
Service.</p>

<p class="ind">In the interview with which your Majesty honoured Sir
Robert Peel yesterday morning, after he had submitted to your
Majesty the names of those whom he proposed to recommend
to your Majesty for the principal executive appointments, he
mentioned to your Majesty his earnest wish to be enabled, with
your Majesty's sanction, so to constitute your Majesty's
Household that your Majesty's confidential servants might
have the advantage of a public demonstration of your Majesty's
full support and confidence, and that at the same time, as far as
possible consistently with that demonstration, each individual
appointment in the Household should be entirely acceptable to
your Majesty's personal feelings.</p>

<p class="ind">On your Majesty's expressing a desire that the Earl of
Liverpool<sup>40</sup> should hold an office in the Household, Sir Robert
Peel requested your Majesty's permission at once to offer to
Lord Liverpool the office of Lord Steward, or any other which
he might prefer.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel then observed that he should have every
wish to apply a similar principle to the chief appointments
which are filled by the Ladies of your Majesty's Household, upon
which your Majesty was pleased to remark that you must
reserve the whole of those appointments, and that it was your
Majesty's pleasure that the whole should continue as at present,
without any change.</p>

<p class="ind">The Duke of Wellington, in the interview to which your
Majesty subsequently admitted him, understood also that this
was your Majesty's determination, and concurred with Sir
Robert Peel in opinion that, considering the great difficulties
of the present crisis, and the expediency of making every effort
in the first instance to conduct the public business of the country
with the aid of the present Parliament, it was essential to
the success of the Commission with which your Majesty had
honoured Sir Robert Peel, that he should have that public proof
of your Majesty's entire support and confidence which would
be afforded by the permission to make some changes in that
part of your Majesty's Household which your Majesty resolved
on maintaining entirely without change.</p>

<p class="ind">Having had the opportunity through your Majesty's gracious
consideration, of reflecting upon this point, he humbly
submits to your Majesty that he is reluctantly compelled, by a
sense of public duty and of the interests of your Majesty's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.170" id="pagei.170"></a>[page&nbsp;170]</span>
service, to adhere to his opinion which he ventured to express
to your Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">He trusts he may be permitted at the same time to express
to your Majesty his grateful acknowledgments for the distinction
which your Majesty conferred upon him by requiring
his advice and assistance in the attempt to form an Administration,
and his earnest prayers that whatever arrangements
your Majesty may be enabled to make for that purpose may
be most conducive to your Majesty's personal comfort and
happiness, and to the promotion of the public welfare.</p>

ten minutes to three. I placed in his hands Sir Robert Peel's
answer, which he read. He started at one part where he (Sir
Robert) says, "<i>some</i> changes"&mdash;but some or all, I said, was
the same; and Lord Melbourne said, "I must submit this
to the Cabinet." Lord Melbourne showed me a letter from
Lord Grey about it&mdash;a good deal alarmed, thinking I was
right, and yet half doubtful; one from Spring Rice, dreadfully
frightened, and wishing the Whig ladies should resign; and
one from Lord Lansdowne wishing to state that the ladies
would have resigned. Lord Melbourne had also seen the Duke
of Richmond, and Lord Melbourne said we might be beat; I
said I never would yield, and would never apply to Peel again.
Lord Melbourne said, "You are for standing out, then?" I
said, "Certainly." I asked how the Cabinet felt. "John
Russell, strongly for standing out," he said; "Duncannon,
very much so; Holland, Lord Minto, Hobhouse, and the
Chancellor, all for standing out; Poulett Thomson too, and
Normanby also; S. Rice and Howick alarmed."</p>

<p class="ind2">Her Majesty's Confidential Servants having taken into consideration
the letter addressed by Her Majesty to Sir Robert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.171" id="pagei.171"></a>[page&nbsp;171]</span>
Peel on the 10th of May, and the reply of Sir Robert Peel of the
same day, are of opinion that for the purpose of giving to an
Administration that character of efficiency and stability and
those marks of the constitutional support of the Crown, which
are required to enable it to act usefully for the public service,
it is reasonable that the great offices of the Court and the
situations in the Household held by members of either House of
Parliament should be included in the political arrangements
made on a change of Administration; but they are not of
opinion that a similar principle should be applied or extended
to the offices held by Ladies in Her Majesty's Household.<sup>41</sup></p>


<p class="footnote1">Footnote 41: This paragraph was read by Lord John Russell to the House of Commons during the
course of the Ministerial explanations on 13th May.
</p>

<p class="ind2" style="margin-top: 1em;">Her Majesty's Confidential Servants are therefore prepared
to support Her Majesty in refusing to assent to the removal of
the Ladies of her Household, which Her Majesty conceived
to be contrary to usage, and which is repugnant to her
feelings, and are prepared to continue in their offices on these
grounds.</p>

<p class="ind2">Viscount Howick concurs in the opinion expressed in the
foregoing Minute that the removal of the Ladies of Her
Majesty's Household ought not to form part of the arrangements
consequent upon a change of Administration, and shares
in the readiness his colleagues have declared to support Her
Majesty in acting upon this opinion; but he thinks it his duty
to state his conviction that the immediate resumption of their
offices by Her Majesty's Confidential Servants is not the
mode in which their support can be most effectively afforded
and is not calculated to promote the good of Her Majesty's
service.</p>

<p class="ind2">He conceives that before it is determined that the present
Administration should be continued, further explanation
should be sought with Sir Robert Peel, by which it is not
impossible that his concession to Her Majesty's just objection to
the removal of the Ladies of her Household might have been obtained,
while the endeavour to arrive at this result, even though
unsuccessful, would at all events tend to secure additional
support to Her Majesty's present Servants, and thus to enable
them to surmount those difficulties, which have recently
compelled them humbly to tender their resignations to Her
Majesty, and which he fears will be found not to have been
diminished by the course it has now been determined to
pursue.</p>

<p class="ind2">In humbly submitting this opinion to Her Majesty, Viscount
Howick begs permission to add that he nevertheless acquiesces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.172" id="pagei.172"></a>[page&nbsp;172]</span>
in the determination of his colleagues, and will render them the
best assistance in his power in their endeavour to carry on Her
Majesty's service.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen is very anxious to hear that Lord Melbourne
has not suffered from the ball last night, as it was very hot at
first. The beginning was rather dull and heavy, but after
supper it got very animated, and we kept it up till a quarter
past three; the Queen enjoyed herself very much and isn't at
all tired; she felt much the kindness of many of her kind
friends, who are her <i>only real</i> friends. Lady Cowper and Lord
and Lady Minto, the Duchess of Somerset, and Lord Anglesey
were particularly kind. On the other hand, there were some
gloomy faces to be seen, and the Duchess of Gloucester was
very cross.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen is ashamed to say it, but she has forgotten <i>when</i>
she appointed the Judge Advocate; when will the Cabinet be
over?</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen danced the first and the last dance with the
Grand Duke,<sup>42</sup> made him sit near her, and tried to be very civil
to him, and I think we are great friends already and get on very
well; I like him exceedingly.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen anxiously hopes Lord Melbourne is quite well
this morning, and has <i>not</i> suffered from the dinner at Pozzo's.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen wishes to know if she ought to say anything to
the Duchess, of the noble manner in which her Government
mean to stand by her? The account in the <i>Observer</i> of the
whole proceeding is the most correct both as to details and
facts, that the Queen has yet seen; were they told what to put
in? There was considerable applause when the Queen
entered the Theatre, which she, however, thought best and
most delicate not to encourage, and she was cheered when she
drove up to the Theatre and got out, which she never is in
general.</p>

<p class="ind">The Grand Duke came and sat with the Queen in her box,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.173" id="pagei.173"></a>[page&nbsp;173]</span>
for at least half an hour last night&mdash;and the Queen asked him if
he knew exactly what had happened, which he said he did not&mdash;and
the Queen accordingly gave him an account of what passed,
and he was <i>shocked</i> at Sir Robert Peel's proposal, thought his
resignation on that account absurd, and was delighted at the
continuance in office of my present Government.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen supposes and fears that Lord Melbourne dines
with the Lansdownes to-morrow, but she wishes to know if
Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday would suit him?</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne must not forget the List of our supporters
in the House of Commons, which the Queen is very anxious to
have as soon as possible. If Lord Melbourne can dine here

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel made a skilful, and not unfair statement.
He, however, spoke only of his intention of changing some of

It is very natural that your Majesty does not. Lord Melbourne

there was, every allowance would be made for the fatigue and

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dear Uncle</span>,&mdash;I begin to think you have forgotten me,
and you will think I have forgotten you, but I am certain you
will have guessed the cause of my silence. How much has
taken place since Monday the 7th to yesterday the 13th. You
will have easily imagined how dreadful the resignation of my
Government&mdash;and particularly of that truly inestimable and
excellent man, Lord Melbourne&mdash;was for me, and you will
have felt for me! What I suffered I cannot describe!
To have to take people whom I should have no confidence
in, ... was most painful and disagreeable; but I felt I
must do it, and made up my mind to it&mdash;nobly advised and
supported by Lord Melbourne, whose character seems to me
still more perfect and noble since I have gone through all
this.</p>

<p class="ind">I sent for the Duke of Wellington, who referred me to Peel,
whom I accordingly saw.</p>

<p class="ind">Everything fair and just I assented to, even to having
Lord Lyndhurst as Chancellor, and Sir H. Hardinge
and Lord Ellenborough in the Cabinet; I insisted upon
the Duke in the Foreign Office, instead of Lord Aberdeen....
All this I granted, as also to give up all the
Officers of State and all those of my Household who are in
Parliament.</p>

<p class="ind">When to my utter astonishment he asked me to change my
Ladies&mdash;my principal Ladies!&mdash;this I of course refused; and
he upon <i>this resigned</i>, saying, as he felt he should be beat the
very first night upon the Speaker, and having to begin with a
minority, that unless he had this demonstration of my confidence
he could not go on!</p>

<p class="ind">You will easily imagine that I firmly resisted this attack upon
my power, from these people who pride themselves upon upholding
the prerogative! I acted quite alone, but I have been,
and shall be, supported by my country, who are very enthusiastic
about it, and loudly cheered me on going to church
on Sunday. My Government have nobly stood by me, and
have resumed their posts, strengthened by the feelings of the
country....</p>

<p class="ind">Pray tell my dearest Aunt that I really cannot write to her
to-day, for you have no conception of what I have to do, for
there are balls, concerts, and dinners all going on besides.
Adieu! my beloved Uncle. Ever your devoted Niece,</p>

<span class="rightnote">APPROVAL OF KING LEOPOLD</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Laeken</span>, <i>17th May 1839</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Victoria</span>,&mdash;I feel deeply grateful for your
very kind and interesting letter, which reached me yesterday,
inclusive of the papers.</p>

<p class="ind">You have passed a time of great agitation and difficulty,
which will, however, contribute to enlarge the circle of
your experience. <i>I approve very highly of the whole mode
in which you proceeded</i>; you acted with great <i>good faith</i>
and <i>fairness</i>, and when finally propositions were made
which you considered you could not submit to, you were
very right to resist them. The march of the whole affair
is very clear and fair, and does you <i>great credit</i>.... Peel
in making his demand misjudged you; he remembered
George IV., and even the late King, and dreamt of Court
influence of people near the Sovereign. You have the great
merit, for which you cannot be too much praised, of being
<i>extremely honest</i> and honourable in your dealings. If you
had kept Peel, you would have acted honestly by him, without
any Lady's having a chance of doing him a bad turn.
When he asked the measure as an expression of your great
confidence in him, it was not fair, because <i>you</i> had not wished
to take him; he was forced upon you, and therefore, even if you
had granted his request, nobody would have seen in it a proof
of your confidence in him, but rather a sacrifice to a far-stretched
pretence.</p>

<p class="ind">Besides, that he was to have encountered difficulties as a
Minister was partly the consequence of the policy of his party,
and you were not bound to give him any assistance beyond
what he had a right to ask as a Minister. I was sure that
Lord Melbourne would give you both the fairest and the most
honourable advice in this painful crisis. He was kind enough
last year to speak to me on the subject, and I could but approve
what he said on the subject. Altogether, keeping now your
old Ministers, you will have reason to congratulate yourself
on the result; it is likely to strengthen them, by showing the
Radicals what may be the consequences.</p>

<p class="ind" style="margin-bottom: 5em;">Rumour spoke of their wishing to add some Radicals to the
Cabinet; I don't see that they could improve the Ministry
by it, which is perfectly well composed as it is at present, and
new elements often have a dissolving effect. It was very kind
of you to have explained everything so clearly to me, but I
deserve it for the <i>great interest</i> I take in all that concerns
you....</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dear Uncle</span>,&mdash;I have no letter from you, but hope to

<p class="ind">I shall send this letter by a courier, as I am anxious to put
several questions to you, and to mention some feelings of mine
upon the subject of my cousins' visit, which I am desirous
should not transpire. First of all, I wish to know if <i>Albert</i> is
aware of the wish of his <i>Father</i> and <i>you</i> relative to <i>me?</i>
Secondly,
if he knows that there is <i>no engagement</i> between us? I
am anxious that you should acquaint Uncle Ernest, that if I
should like Albert, that I can make <i>no final promise this year</i>,
for, at the <i>very earliest</i>, any such event could not take place till
<i>two or three years hence</i>. For, independent of my youth, and
my <i>great</i> repugnance to change my present position, there is <i>no
anxiety</i> evinced in <i>this country</i> for such an event, and it would
be more prudent, in my opinion, to wait till some such demonstration
is shown,&mdash;else if it were hurried it might produce
discontent.</p>

<p class="ind">Though all the reports of Albert are most favourable, and
though I have little doubt I shall like him, still one can never
answer beforehand for <i>feelings</i>, and I may not have the <i>feeling</i>

anxious that it should be understood that I am <i>not</i> guilty of
any breach of promise, for <i>I never gave any</i>. I am sure you
will understand my anxiety, for I should otherwise, were this
not completely understood, be in a very painful position. As
it is, I am rather nervous about the visit, for the subject I
allude to is not an agreeable one to me. I have little else to
say, dear Uncle, as I have now spoken openly to you, which I
was very, <i>very anxious</i> to do.</p>

least for some little time. The affairs of the Orient interest a
good deal. I think that it is better the Porte should be on a
favourable footing with Mehemet Ali than if that gentleman
had pushed on in arms, as it will put the <i>casus foederis</i> out of
the question, and the Turks will not call in the assistance of
the Russians. Whoever pushed the late Sultan into this war
has done an act of great folly, as it could only bring the Porte

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne will wait upon your Majesty at a quarter
before five, if possible, but there is much to discuss at the
Cabinet. The Caspian Pasha has taken the Turkish fleet to
Alexandria,<sup>50</sup> and Mehemet Ali says that he will not give it up
to the Sultan until he dismisses the Grand Vizier, and acknowledges
the hereditary right of the Pasha to the countries which
he at present governs. This is to make the Sultan his subject
and his vassal.</p>

the Turkish fleet despatched to Syria. But the Admiral treacherously sailed to Alexandria,
and the Ottoman troops, under Hafiz, who had succeeded Mehemet Ali in the Government
of Egypt, were utterly routed. With the traitorous conduct of the Turkish
admiral, Disraeli, a few years later, compared Peel's conversion to Free Trade.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen hopes Lord Melbourne is quite well this morning,
and did not sit up working very late last night; the Queen met
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.180" id="pagei.180"></a>[page&nbsp;180]</span>
him twice yesterday in the Park, and really wondered how
anybody <i>could</i> ride, for she came home much hotter than she
went out, and thought the air quite like as if it came out of an
oven; to-day we can breathe again. It was intensely hot at
the Opera; the Queen-Dowager visited the Queen in her box,
as did also the young Grand Duke of Weimar, who is just
returned from Scotland, and whom the Queen has asked to
come after dinner to-morrow. The Queen has not asked the
Duke of Sussex to come after dinner to-morrow, as she thought
he would be bored by such a sort of party; does not Lord
Melbourne think so? and she means to ask him to dinner soon.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has not asked Lord Melbourne about any days
this week besides to-morrow (when she trusts he may be able
to come, but she does not know what there is in the House)
and Wednesday; but perhaps Lord Melbourne will consent
to leave Thursday and Friday open in <i>case</i> he should be able
to come one or both of those days.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has just received Lord Melbourne's letter; and
wishes to know if Lord Melbourne means by "to-day" that
he is also coming to see her <i>this afternoon</i>, (which she does not
expect) as well as <i>this evening</i>? for she did <i>not</i> ask him in her
note of this morning <i>if</i> he would come to-night (for she felt <i>sure</i>
of that), but if he could come <i>to-morrow</i>, about which he has
not answered her, as to whether he expects there will be anything
of great length in the House of Lords. Lord Melbourne
will forgive the Queen's troubling him again, but she felt a
little puzzled by his letter; she sent him a card for Wednesday
without previously asking him, as she thought that would suit
him, and hopes it does?</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen will follow Lord Melbourne's advice respecting
the Duke of Sussex.</p>

<p class="ind">We have just returned from hearing not only a very long,

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Laeken</span>, <i>9th August 1839</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">... I am sorry that you are less pleased with the old Duke,
but party spirit is in England an incurable disease. These last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.181" id="pagei.181"></a>[page&nbsp;181]</span>
two years he had rendered essential service to the present
Administration; perhaps he has been soured by last summer's
events. It was my intention to have answered your questions
sooner, but from Paris I had not the means. Now the time
draws so near when I hope to have the happiness of seeing you,
that I think it will be better to treat the matter verbally, the
more so as my most beloved Majesty is easily displeased with
what may be written with the best intention, instead that in
conversation the immediate reply renders any misunderstanding,
however small, very difficult; and as I do not wish to have
any great or small with you, and see no occasion for it, I will
give my answer <i>de vive voix</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Now comes a subject which will <i>astonish</i> you. I am charged
<i>de sonder</i> your will and pleasure on the following subject. The
King my father-in-law goes to Eu, where he hopes to remain
till the 5th or 6th of September. Having at his disposition
some very fine steamers, his great wish would be to go over to
Brighton, just for one afternoon and night, to offer you his
respects in person. He would in such a case bring with him
the Queen, my Aunt, Cl&eacute;mentine,<sup>52</sup> Aumale and Montpensier.
The first step in this business is to know what your pleasure is,
and to learn that very frankly, as he perfectly understands
that, however short such a visit, it must be submitted to the
advice even of some of your Ministers. What renders the thing
very difficult, in my opinion, is that in a country like France,
and with so many Ministerial difficulties, the King to the <i>last
hour</i> will hardly know if he can undertake the thing. As,
however, the first object is to know your will, he begged me to
ascertain that, and to tell you that if you had the <i>smallest
objection</i> you would not be carried away by the apprehension
of hurting him by telling me honestly that you did <i>not</i> see how
the affair could be arranged, but to speak out, that he knew
enough how often objections may arise, and that even with
himself he could only be sure of the thing at the last moment.</p>

Melbourne nor Viscount Palmerston are of opinion that it
would be expedient that your Majesty should send an Ambassador
Extraordinary to compliment the young Sultan<sup>54</sup> on
his accession. The circumstances connected with his accession
are indeed fitter matter for condolence than for congratulation,
and he would probably be better pleased by the restoration of
his fleet than by the arrival of Ambassadors Extraordinary.
Moreover, it has not been customary for the Sovereign of England
to send such missions upon the accession of Sultans.</p>

Mehemet, and direct the Alliance against Russia. But Nicholas I. of Russia was prepared
to support England as far as regarded the affairs of Turkey and Egypt, and to close the
Dardanelles and Bosphorus to war-ships of all nations, it being stipulated that Russian
ships of war only were to pass the Bosphorus, as acting under the mandate of Europe in
defence of the Turks. <i>See</i> further, Introductory Notes for <a href="#pagei.141" style="font-weight: normal;">1839</a> and <a href="#pagei.209" style="font-weight: normal;">1840.</a>

rooms in the Palace, which I think might be easily managed.
As far as we are concerned, it <i>does not matter</i> if we are housed

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Uncle,</span>&mdash;I had already written you a letter
when I received your two very kind ones, and I shall therefore
not send my first. My friendship for the dear King and Queen
makes me, as you may easily understand, wish most exceedingly
to see them and to make the acquaintance of the Queen
and all the family. And I feel the immense kindness of them
all in wishing to see me, and in coming over for only a few hours.
Politically it would be <i>wished</i> by <i>us all</i>, and the <i>only</i>
difficulty I see is the following, which is, that <i>I do not feel quite</i> equal to
going to Brighton and receiving them all, so soon after the
Prorogation.<sup>55</sup> I do not <i>feel</i> well; I feel <i>thoroughly</i> exhausted
from all that I have gone through this Session, and am quite
knocked up by the two little trips I made to Windsor. This
makes me fear, uncertain as it all is, with such a pressure of
business, so many affairs, and with so much going on, that I
should be unequal to the journey and the whole thing. This,
and this <i>alone</i>, could make me express a wish that this most
kind visit should take place <i>next</i> year instead of this year. I
feel such regret really in saying this&mdash;I should so wish to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.184" id="pagei.184"></a>[page&nbsp;184]</span>
them, and yet I feel I am not <i>quite</i> up to it. You will understand
me, dear Uncle, I am certain, as I know the anxiety you
always express for my health. For <i>once</i> I <i>long</i> to leave London,
and shall do so on Friday. If you could be at Windsor by the
4th, I should be delighted.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>26 August 1839</i>.
(<i>10 minutes to 12</i>.)</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received both Lord Melbourne's notes; she
was a good deal vexed at his not coming, as she had begged him
herself to do so, and as he wrote to say he would, and also as
she thinks it right and of importance that Lord Melbourne
should be here at large dinners; the Queen <i>insists</i> upon his
coming to dinner to-morrow, and also begs him to do so on
Wednesday, her two last nights in town, and as she will
probably not see him at all for two days when she goes on
Friday; the Queen would wish to see Lord Melbourne <i>after</i>
the Prorogation to-morrow at any hour <i>before</i> five he likes
best.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has been a good deal annoyed this evening at
Normanby's telling her that John Russell was coming to town
next Monday in order to <i>change</i> with <i>him</i>.<sup>56</sup> Lord Melbourne
<i>never</i> told the Queen that this was definitely settled; on the
contrary, he said it would "remain in our hands," to use Lord
Melbourne's own words, and only be settled during the Vacation;
considering all that the Queen has said on the subject
to Lord Melbourne, and considering the great confidence the
Queen has in Lord Melbourne, she thinks and feels he ought to
have told her that this was <i>settled</i>, and not let the Queen be the
last person to hear what is settled and done in her own name;
Lord Melbourne will excuse the Queen's being a little eager about
this, but it has happened once before that she learnt from other
people what had been decided on.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has such unlimited confidence in Lord Melbourne
that she knows all that he does is right, but she cannot help
being a little vexed at not being told things, when she is accustomed
to great confidence on Lord Melbourne's part.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.185" id="pagei.185"></a>[page&nbsp;185]</span>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne may rely on the Queen's secrecy respecting
Howick; he knows the Queen always keeps things to herself;
Normanby hinted at his wish to get rid of Howick.</p>

<p class="ind">The Speech is safely arrived, has been read over twice, and
shall not be forgotten to-morrow; the Queen wishes they would
not use such thin and slippery paper&mdash;for it is difficult to hold
with nervous, and, as Lord Melbourne knows, <i>shaking</i> hands.
The Queen trusts Lord Melbourne will be less tired in the
morning.</p>

arrived and went like <i>an arrow to my heart</i>. Yes, my beloved
Victoria! I <i>do love you tenderly</i>, and with all the power of
affection which is often found in characters who do not make
much outward show of it. I love you <i>for yourself</i>, and I love
in you the dear child whose welfare I carefully watched. My
great wish is always that you should <i>know</i> that I am <i>desirous</i>
of <i>being useful</i> to you, without <i>hoping for any other return</i> than
some little affection from your warm and kind heart. I am
even so far pleased that my eternal political affairs are settled,
as it takes away the <i>last possibility</i> of imagining that I may
want something or other. I have all the honours that can be
given, and I am, politically speaking, very solidly established,
more so than most Sovereigns in Europe. The only political
longing I still have is for the Orient, where I perhaps shall once
end my life, unlike the sun, rising in the West and setting in the
East. I never press my services on you, nor my councils,
though I may say with some truth that from the extraordinary
fate which the higher Powers had ordained for me, my experience,
both political and of private life, is great. I am <i>always
ready</i> to be useful to you <i>when and where</i> it may be, and I
repeat it, <i>all I want in return is some little sincere affection from
you</i>....</p>

<p class="ind">And now I conclude for to-day, not without expressing again
my satisfaction and pleasure at having seen you yesterday
morning with your dear honest face, looking so dear in your

when everything else is delightful. Once more, God bless

wish. In the first place I don't think one can <i>reckon</i> on the
Cousins arriving here on the 30th. Well, all I want is that <i>you</i>
should detain them one or two days longer, in order that they
may arrive here on <i>Thursday, the 3rd</i>, if possible <i>early</i>. My
reason for this is as follows: a number of the Ministers are
coming down here on Monday to stay till Thursday, on affairs
of great importance, and as you know that people are always
on the alert to make remarks, I think if <i>all</i> the Ministers were to
be down here when they arrive, people would say&mdash;it was to
<i>settle matters</i>. At all events it is better to avoid this. I think
indeed a day or two at Brussels will do these young gentlemen
good, and they can be properly fitted out there for their visit.

Albert plagues Leopold beyond measure.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dear Uncle,</span>&mdash;... The dear cousins arrived at half-past
seven on Thursday, after a very bad and almost dangerous
passage, but looking both very well, and much improved.
Having no clothes, they could not appear at dinner, but nevertheless
<i>d&eacute;but&eacute;d</i> after dinner in their <i>n&eacute;glig&eacute;</i>. Ernest is grown
quite handsome; Albert's <i>beauty</i> is <i>most striking</i>, and he so
amiable and unaffected&mdash;in short, very <i>fascinating</i>; he is
excessively admired here. The Granvilles and Lord Clanricarde<sup>59</sup>
happened just to be here, but are gone again to-day.
We rode out yesterday and danced after dinner. The young
men are very amiable, delightful companions, and I am very
happy to have them here; they are playing some Symphonies
of Haydn <i>under</i> me at this very moment; they are passionately
fond of music.</p>

<p class="ind">In the way of news I have got nothing to tell you to-day.
Everything is quiet here, and we have no particular news from

<span class="rightnote">A MOMENTOUS DECISION</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>15th October 1839</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Uncle,</span>&mdash;This letter will, I am sure, give you
pleasure, for you have always shown and taken so warm an
interest in all that concerns me. My mind is quite made up&mdash;and
I told Albert this morning of it; the warm affection he
showed me on learning this gave me <i>great</i> pleasure. He seems
<i>perfection</i>, and I think that I have the prospect of very great
happiness before me. I <i>love</i> him <i>more</i> than I can say, and I
shall do everything in my power to render the sacrifice he has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.189" id="pagei.189"></a>[page&nbsp;189]</span>
made (for a <i>sacrifice</i> in my opinion it is) as small as I can. He
seems to have a very great tact&mdash;a very necessary thing in his
position. These last few days have passed like a dream to me,
and I am so much bewildered by it all that I know hardly how
to write; but I <i>do</i> feel <i>very</i>, <i>very</i> happy.</p>

<p class="ind">It is absolutely necessary that this determination of mine
should be known to <i>no one</i> but yourself, and Uncle Ernest&mdash;till
the meeting of Parliament&mdash;as it would be considered otherwise
neglectful on my part not to have assembled Parliament
at once to have informed them of it.... Lord Melbourne, whom
I of course have consulted about the whole affair, quite
approves my choice, and expresses great satisfaction at the
event, which he thinks in every way highly desirable. Lord
Melbourne has acted in this business, as he has always done
towards me, with the greatest kindness and affection.</p>

<p class="ind">We also think it better, and Albert quite approves of it,
that we should be married very soon after Parliament meets,
about the beginning of February; and indeed, loving Albert
as I do, I cannot wish it should be delayed. My feelings are a
<i>little</i> changed, I must say, since last Spring, when I said I
couldn't <i>think</i> of marrying for <i>three or four years</i>; but seeing
Albert has changed all this.</p>

<p class="ind">Pray, dearest Uncle, forward these two letters to Uncle Ernest
(to whom I beg you will enjoin <i>strict</i> secrecy, and explain these
details, which I have not time to do) and to faithful Stockmar.</p>

<p class="ind">I think you might tell Louise of it, but none of her family.
I should wish to keep the dear young gentlemen here till the
end of next month. Ernest's sincere pleasure gave me great
delight. He does so adore dearest Albert. Ever, dearest
Uncle, your devoted Niece,</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Wiesbaden</span>, <i>24th October 1839</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Victoria,</span>&mdash;Nothing could have given me
greater pleasure than your dear letter. I had, when I saw your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.190" id="pagei.190"></a>[page&nbsp;190]</span>
decision, almost the feeling of old Zacharias<sup>61</sup>&mdash;"Now lettest
Thou Thy servant depart in peace"! Your choice had been
for these last years my conviction of what might and would be
<i>best</i> for your happiness; and just because I was convinced of
it, and knowing how <i>strangely</i> fate often <i>deranges</i> what one tries
to bring about as being the best plan one could fix upon, <i>the
maximum of a good arrangement</i>, I feared that it would <i>not</i>
happen. In your position, which may and will, perhaps,
become in future even more difficult in a political point of
view, <i>you could not exist</i> without having a <i>happy</i> and an
<i>agreeable
int&eacute;rieur</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">And I am much deceived&mdash;which I think I am not&mdash;or you
will find in Albert just the very qualities and dispositions which
are indispensable for your happiness, and <i>which will suit your
own character, temper, and mode of life</i>. You say most amiably
that you consider it a sacrifice on the part of Albert. This is
true in many points, because his position will be a difficult one;
but much, I may say <i>all</i>, will depend on your affection for him.
If <i>you love him, and are kind to him</i>, he will easily bear the
burthen of the position; and there is a steadiness and at the
same time cheerfulness in his character which will facilitate this.
I think your plans excellent. If Parliament had been called
at an unusual time it would make them uncomfortable, and if,
therefore, they receive the communication at the opening of
the Session, it will be best. The marriage, as you say, might
then follow as closely as possible.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne has shown himself the <i>amiable</i> and <i>excellent</i>
man I always took him for. Another man in his position,
instead of <i>your</i> happiness, might have merely looked to his own
personal views and imaginary interests. Not so our good friend;
he saw what was best <i>for you</i>, and I feel it deeply to his praise.</p>

<p class="ind">Your keeping the cousins next month with you strikes me
as a very good plan. It will even show that you had sufficient
opportunity of judging of Albert's character....</p>
<span class="rightnote">AUSTRIA AND THE PORTE</span>
<p class="ind">On the 22nd, Prince Metternich came to see me. He was
very kind, and talked most confidentially about political affairs,
particularly the Oriental concerns.<sup>62</sup> M. de Brunnow had been
with him. The short of his views is this: he wishes that the
Powers could be <i>unanimous</i>, as he sees in this the best chance
of avoiding measures of violence against the Pasha of Egypt,
which he considers <i>dangerous</i>, either as <i>not</i> sufficiently
effective,
or of a nature to bring on complications most earnestly to be
avoided, such as making use of Russian troops.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.191" id="pagei.191"></a>[page&nbsp;191]</span>
Austria naturally would like to bring about the best possible
arrangement for the Porte, but it will adhere to any arrangement
or proposition which can be agreed upon by England and
France. He is, however, positive that Candia must be given
back to the Porte, its position being too threatening, and therefore
constantly alarming the Porte. He made me write the
import of our conversation to King Louis Philippe, which I
did send after him to Frankfort, where he was to forward it to
Paris. Perhaps you will have the goodness to communicate
this political scrap to good Lord Melbourne with my best
regards. He spoke in praise of Lord Beauvale.<sup>63</sup> The Prince
is better, but grown very old and looking tired. It gave me
great pleasure to see him again.</p>

<p class="ind">I drink the waters now four days, and can therefore not yet
judge of their good or bad effects. My palpitations are rather
increased here; if my stupid heart will get diseased I shall soon
be departing for some other world. I would it could be soon
then.</p>

<p class="ind">Till further orders I shall say nothing to your Mother,
Charles, or Feodore.</p>

<p class="ind">Now I will conclude with my best blessings, and remain, my
dearest and most beloved Victoria, your devoted Uncle,</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Uncle,</span>&mdash;Your most kind and most welcome
letter of the 24th arrived yesterday, and gave me very, very
great pleasure. I was sure you would be satisfied and pleased
with our proceedings.</p>

<p class="ind">Before I proceed further, I wish just to mention one or two
alterations in the plan of announcing the event.</p>

<p class="ind">As Parliament has <i>nothing</i> whatever to say respecting the
marriage, can neither approve nor disapprove it (I mean in
a manner which might <i>affect</i> it), it is now proposed that, as
soon as the cousins are gone (which they now intend to do on
the 12th or 14th of November, as time presses), I should
assemble all the Privy Councillors and announce to them my
intention....</p>

<p class="ind">Oh! dear Uncle, I <i>do</i> feel so happy! I do so adore Albert!
he is quite an angel, and so very, very kind to me, and seems
so fond of me, which touches me much. I trust and hope I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.192" id="pagei.192"></a>[page&nbsp;192]</span>
shall be able to make him as happy as he <i>ought</i> to be! I cannot
bear to part from him, for we spend such happy, delightful
hours together.</p>

<p class="ind">Poor Ernest has been suffering since Wednesday last with
the jaundice, which is very distressing and troublesome,
though not alarming.... I love him dearly too, and look
upon him quite as a brother.</p>

<p class="ind">What you say about Lord Melbourne has given me great
pleasure; it is very just and very true. There are not many
<i>such</i> honest kind friends to be found in this world. He desires
me to say that he is deeply sensible of your good opinion, and
that he can have no other object than that which he considers
best to secure my happiness, which is closely connected with
the well-being of the country.</p>

<p class="ind">I am glad you saw Prince Metternich, and that you were
satisfied with the interview.</p>

<p class="ind">I hope and trust you may derive much benefit from your
stay at Wiesbaden. Pray name me to good Stockmar, and
believe me, always, your most devoted Niece and Child,</p>

<span class="rightnote">CONGRATULATIONS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Laeken</span>, <i>9th November 1839</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My most beloved Victoria,</span>&mdash;Your Uncle has already told
you, I trust, with what feelings of deep affection and gratitude
I received the so <i>interesting</i> and <i>important</i> communication
which you permitted him to make to me; but I was longing
for an opportunity to speak to you myself of the great subject
which fills now our hearts, and to tell you how very grateful
I have been, I am, and will ever be, for the confidence and
trust which you so kindly placed in me. All I can say is that
you did full justice to my feelings, for <i>nothing</i> could interest
<i>more</i> my heart than <i>your</i> marriage, my most dearly loved
Victoria, and I could not have heard even of that of Cl&eacute;mentine
with <i>more</i> anxious affection and sisterly love. I cannot
really tell you <i>with words</i> how deeply and strongly I was moved
and affected by the great news itself, and by your dear, unaffected,
confiding, happy letter. When I received it I could
do nothing but cry, and say internally, "May God bless her
now and ever!" Ah! may God bless you, my most beloved
Victoria! may He shower on you His best blessings, fulfil <i>all</i>
your heart's wishes and hopes, and let you enjoy for <i>many,
many years</i> the happiness which the dearest ties of affection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.193" id="pagei.193"></a>[page&nbsp;193]</span>
<i>alone</i> can give, and which is the only <i>real</i> one, the only worthy
of the name in this uncertain and transitory world!</p>

<p class="ind">I have seen much of dear Albert two years ago, I have
watched him, as you may well think, with particular care,
attention, and interest, and although he was very young then,
I am well convinced that he is not only fit for the situation
which he is now called to fulfil, but, what is still more important
in my eyes, that he has <i>all those qualities</i> of the heart
and the mind which can give and ensure happiness. I think
even that his disposition is particularly well calculated to suit
yours, and I am fully confident that you will be both happy
together. What you tell me of your fear of not being worthy of
him, and able to make him sufficiently happy, is for me but a
proof more of it. Deep affection makes us always diffident
and <i>very humble</i>. Those that we love stand so high in our
own esteem, and are in our opinion so much above us and all
others that we naturally feel unworthy of them and unequal
to the task of making them happy: but there is, I think, a
mingled charm in this feeling, for although we regret not to be
what we should wish to be for them, feeling and acknowledging
the superiority of those we love and must always love and
respect, is a great satisfaction, and an increasing and everlasting
one. You will feel it, I am sure, as well as I do....</p>

<p class="ind">You will excuse my blots and hurried scribbling when I will
tell you that in order to profit of the private messenger which
goes to-morrow morning I write to you at ten in the evening,
a thing quite unusual for me, and even rather forbidden: but
after having been deprived of expending my heart for so many
days, I could not <i>not</i> avail myself of the present opportunity.
When I write to you by the ordinary messenger I will continue
to be <i>silent</i>; but I trust you will permit me to say some time
a word, when a safe opportunity presents itself, for my heart
is with you more than I can tell. I would that I could see you,
when it could be, for an hour. I remain, my most beloved
Victoria, ever and ever your most affectionate</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE PEERAGE QUESTION</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Wiesbaden</span>, <i>22nd November 1839</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Victoria,</span>&mdash;I was delighted with your dear
little letter. You write these kind of letters with a very great
facility, and they are generally so natural and clever, that it
makes one very happy to receive them. I had written less of
late, because I thought you occupied more agreeably than
to read my letters. I have on purpose kept back a courier,
to be able to send you the latest news from here of M. Albert.
The young people arrived here only on the 20th, in the morning,
having very kindly stopped at Bonn. I find them looking
well, particularly Albert; it proves that happiness is an
excellent remedy, and keeps people in better health than any
other. He is much attached to you, and moved when he speaks
of you. He is, besides, in great spirits and gaiety, and full of
fun; he is a very amiable companion.</p>

<p class="ind">Concerning the peerage, that is a matter to be considered at
any time; the only reason why I do wish it is, that Albert's
foreignership should disappear as much as possible. I have,
in different circumstances to be sure, suffered greatly from my
having declined conditionally the peerage when it was offered
me in 1816.<sup>69</sup> Your Uncle<sup>70</sup> writes to you in German: as far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.198" id="pagei.198"></a>[page&nbsp;198]</span>
as I understood him, he speaks of the necessity of a marriage
treaty; that is a matter of course. There is, however, something
additional to be regulated concerning the possible succession
in the Coburg-Gotha dominions, there being betwixt
it and Albert but good Ernest. Some regulation becomes
therefore necessary, at least reasonable. The Duke wishes
also to know if the treaty is to be made in England or in
Germany. Should the last of the two be fixed upon, he thinks
that one of your Ministers abroad would be the proper person
for it. Ever, my dear Victoria, your devoted Uncle,</p>

is in office he remains his Secretary&mdash;but William
Cowper<sup>75</sup> was also for some time Secretary to his Uncle, and at

<p class="ind">I have received to-day an ungracious letter from Uncle
Leopold. He appears to me to be nettled because I no longer
ask for his advice, but dear Uncle is given to believe that he
must rule the roast everywhere. However, that is not a
necessity. As he has written to Melbourne, Melbourne will
reply to him on every point, and will also tell him that Stockmar
ought to come here as soon as possible to arrange everything
about the treaty. That will be a very good thing,
because Stockmar understands all English things so well.</p>

<p class="ind">The <i>Second</i>, as you always called Palmerston, is to be married
within the next few days to Lady Cowper, the sister of my
Premier (<i>Primus</i>); I have known this for a long time, but
Melbourne asked me not to tell it to any one. They are, both
of them, above fifty, and I think that they are quite right so
to act, because Palmerston, since the death of his sisters, is
quite alone in the world, and <i>Lady C</i>. is a very clever woman,
and <i>much</i> attached to him; still, I feel sure it will make you
smile.</p>


<p class="footnote1">Footnote 76: Mr George Anson had been Private Secretary to Lord Melbourne; it was on Lord
Melbourne's recommendation that the Queen appointed him Private Secretary to Prince
Albert. The Prince was inclined to resent the selection, and to think that in the case of
so confidential an official he should have been allowed to make his own nomination. But
they became firm friends, and the Prince found Mr Anson's capacity, common sense, and
entire disinterestedness of the greatest value to him. Later he became keeper of the
Prince's Privy Purse, and died in 1849.

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Victoria</span>,&mdash;I lived in the hope of receiving
some letters for you from Albert, but nothing is arrived to-day.
Your dear long letter gave me great pleasure. Before I answer
some parts of it, I will say a few words on Lord Melbourne's
letter. Perhaps you will be so good to tell him that it gratified
me much. It is the letter of an honest and an amiable statesman,
practical and straightforward. In the omission of the word
"Protestant" he was probably right, and it is equally probable
that they would have abused him&mdash;maybe even more if
he had put it in. There is only this to say, however: the
Ernestine branch of the Saxon family has been, there is no
doubt, the real cause of the establishment of Protestantism in
Germany, and consequently in great parts of Northern Europe.
This same line became a martyr to that cause, and was deprived
of almost all its possessions in consequence of it.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.205" id="pagei.205"></a>[page&nbsp;205]</span>

<p class="ind">Recently there have been two cases of Catholic marriages, but
the main branch has remained, and is, in fact, very sincerely
Protestant. Both Ernest and Albert are much attached to it,
and when deviations took place they were connected more
with new branches transplanted out of the parent soil than
with what more properly must be considered as the reigning
family.</p>

<p class="ind">The Peerage question may remain as it is, but it will not be
denied that the great object must be to make Albert as English
as possible, and that nothing will render this more difficult
than a foreign name....</p>

<p class="ind">I shall be most happy to see poor Charlotte's bust in the
Gallery at Windsor, and it is kind of you to have had the
thought. She was a high and noble-minded creature, and her
affection and kindness for me very great. She had placed the
most unbounded confidence in me; our principle had been
never to let a single day pass over any little subject of irritation.
The only subjects of that sort we had were about the family,
particularly the Regent, and then the old Queen Charlotte.
Now I must conclude with my best love. Ever, my dearest
Victoria, your devoted Uncle,</p>

which was a long one, and thanks me for two, of the 26th and
29th. This vexes me much, and I can't help thinking the letter
is lying either at Wiesbaden or Brussels. Would you graciously
enquire, for I should not like it to be lost.</p>

Sutherland is here, who admires you much, and is very
sympathetic....</p>

<p class="ind" style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>The 23rd</i>.&mdash;Your letter of the 15th just received. I will now
answer at once. <i>It is, as you rightly suppose, my greatest, my
most anxious wish to do everything most agreeable to you, but I
must differ with you respecting Mr Anson</i>.... <i>What I said about
Anson giving you advice, means, that if you like to ask him, he can
and will be of the greatest use to you, as he is a very well-informed
person. He will leave Lord Melbourne as soon as he is appointed
about you. With regard to your last objection, that it would make
you a party man if you took the Secretary of the Prime Minister
as your Treasurer, I do not agree in it; for, though I am very
anxious you should not appear to belong to a Party, still it is
necessary that your Household should not form a too strong
contrast to mine, else they will say, "Oh, we know the Prince says
he belongs to no party, but we are sure he is a Tory!" Therefore
it is also necessary that it should appear that you went with me in
having some of your people who are staunch Whigs; but Anson is
not in Parliament, and never was, and therefore he is not a violent
politician. Do not think because I urge this, Lord M. prefers
it; on the contrary, he never urged it, and I only do it as I know
it is for your own good</i>. You will pardon this long story. <i>It
will also not do to wait till you come to appoint all your people</i>.
<i>I am distressed to tell you what I fear you do not like</i>, but it is
necessary, my dearest, most excellent Albert. Once more
I tell you that you can perfectly rely on me in these matters....</p>

so I will not say much more about it to-day, but I will just observe
that, tho' I fully understand (indeed no one could feel more for
you in the very trying position you will be placed in than I
do) your feelings, it is absolutely necessary that an Englishman
should be at the head of your affairs; therefore (tho' I will not
force Mr. Anson on you) I ask you if it is not better to take a man
in whom I have confidence, and whom I know well enough to trust
perfectly, than a man who is quite a stranger, and whom I know
nothing of?</i></p>

<p class="ind">I am very glad that your father knows Lord Grosvenor.
As to the Tories, I am still in a rage;<sup>81</sup> they abuse and grumble
incessantly in the most incredible manner.</p>

<p class="ind">I will tell good Lord Melbourne that you are very grateful.
That you will write to him is very nice of you, and makes me
glad. I shall always feel very happy if you, my dearest
Albert, will be very friendly to this good and just man;

intimately, you will be as fond of him as I am. No one is

deserve <i>half a one</i>, as your silence is unpardonable) to say I
have just heard from Albert, who, I am glad to say, consents
to <i>my</i> choosing his people; so <i>one essential</i> point is gained, and
we have only the Treasurer to carry now. I am sure, as you
are so anxious Albert should be thoroughly English, you will
see how necessary it is that an Englishman should be at the
head of his financial affairs.</p>

on purpose in a clear hand, by one of his secretaries, as he

<h3  style="margin-top: 5em;">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>

<h3 style="margin-top: -0.5em;">TO CHAPTER IX</h3>


<p>The marriage of the Queen and Prince Albert took place amid
great splendour and general rejoicings on the 10th of February; the
general satisfaction being unaffected by the tactless conduct of
Ministers who, by not acting in conjunction with the Opposition,
had been defeated on the question of the amount of the Prince's
annuity, the House of Commons reducing it from &pound;50,000 to &pound;30,000.</p>

<p>At home, the Privilege Question aroused great interest, a point
which for months convulsed the Courts and Parliament being whether
a report, ordered by the House to be printed, of a Committee appointed
by the House, was protected by privilege against being the
subject of an action for libel. The Courts having decided that it was
not, an Act was passed to alter the rule for the future, but meanwhile
the sheriffs had been imprisoned by the House for executing the
judgment in the usual course.</p>

<p>The Ministry tottered on, getting a majority of nine only on their
China policy, and twenty-one on a direct vote of confidence. The
Bill for the union of the two Canadas was, however, passed without
difficulty.</p>

<p>An attempt by a barman named Oxford to assassinate the Queen
on Constitution Hill fortunately failed, and Oxford was committed,
after trial, to a lunatic asylum. In July, the prospect of an heir
being born to the throne led to the passing of a Regency Bill, naming
Prince Albert Regent, should the Queen die leaving issue; the Duke
of Sussex alone entered a formal protest against it.</p>

<p>Afghanistan continued unsettled, and Lord Auckland's policy
seemed hardly justified by the unpopularity at Cabul of Shah Sooja;
Dost Mahommed still made efforts to regain his position, but he
ultimately surrendered to Sir William Macnaghten, the British Envoy
at Cabul. The disputes with China continued, and hostilities broke
out; British ships proceeded to China, and Chusan was captured.</p>

<p>In France an attempt against the Government was made by Louis
Napoleon, who landed at Boulogne in a British steamer, was captured,
and sentenced to life imprisonment. More serious difficulties
between this country and France arose out of Eastern affairs. The
Four Powers, England, Russia, Austria, and Prussia, had addressed
an ultimatum to Mehemet, requiring him to evacuate North Syria,
France declining to take part in the conference on the subject. An
Anglo-Austrian army undertook to eject him, St Jean d'Acre was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.210" id="pagei.210"></a>[page&nbsp;210]</span>
stormed, and France thrust into a position of unwilling isolation.
Thiers, who had been made Minister, expected that Mehemet would
be able to retain his conquests, and for a time it looked as though
France would interfere to protect him. Ultimately, in spite of some
ostentatious preparations in France, peaceful counsels prevailed, and
Thiers found it advisable to retire in favour of Guizot.</p>

<p>In Holland, William I. (then sixty-seven) abdicated in favour of
his son, the Prince of Orange (William II.). The need of a younger
and firmer ruler was the reason officially stated in the Royal Proclamation.
The real reasons were probably the King's attachment
to the Roman Catholic Countess d'Oultremont, whom he now privately
married, and the humiliation he felt at the unfavourable
termination of the Belgian dispute.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Stockmar</span> is here; I saw him yesterday and to-day, and have
begged him to explain to you <i>all the Court affairs, and the affairs
concerning the Treaty</i>, in my name. He will explain to you the
Treasury affair, and will do it much better than I should. I
am very happy to see him again, and to have him here; he can
give such good advice to both of us, and he understands England
so fully.... Stocky (as I always used to call him) is so sensible
about everything, and is <i>so much</i> attached to you.</p>

<p class="ind">I shall have no great dinners, because the large rooms in the
upper story here are not yet ready. My good old Primus<sup>1</sup>
usually dines with me three or four times a week, almost always
on Sundays, <i>when I cannot invite other people to dinner, as it is
not reckoned right here for me to give dinners on Sunday, or to
invite many people</i>. Your song (the bust has been mentioned

like so much....</p>

<p class="ind">This letter will be handed you by Torrington personally.
I recommend you not to leave late, so as to make the journey
without hurry. I did not go to church to-day; the weather is
very cold, and I have to be careful not to catch cold before the
16th, because I open Parliament in person. <i>This is always
a nervous proceeding, and the announcement of my marriage at
the beginning of my speech is really a very nervous and awful
affair for me</i>. <i>I have never failed yet, and this is the sixth time
that I have done it, and yet I am just as frightened as if I had never</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.212" id="pagei.212"></a>[page&nbsp;212]</span>
<i>done it before</i>. <i>They say that feeling of nervousness is never got
over, and that Wm. Pitt himself never got up to make a speech
without thinking he should fail</i>. <i>But then I only read my speech</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">I had to-day a visit from George<sup>2</sup> whom I received <i>alone</i>,
and he was very courteous. His Papa I have also seen.</p>

<p class="ind">... Yesterday just as I came home from the House of
Lords,<sup>3</sup> I received your dear letter of the 10th. I cannot understand
at all why you have received no letters from me, seeing
that I always wrote twice a week, regularly....</p>

<p class="ind">I observe with horror that I have not formally invited your
father; though that is a matter of course. My last letter
will have set that right. I ought not to have written to you on
picture notepaper, seeing that we are in deep mourning for my
poor Aunt, the Landgravine,<sup>4</sup> but it was quite impossible for
me to write to you on mourning paper....</p>

<p class="ind"><i>But this will not interfere with our marriage in the least; the
mourning will be taken off for that day, and for two or three days
after, and then put on again</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Everything went off exceedingly well yesterday. There
was an immense multitude of people, and perhaps never,
certainly not for a long time, have I been received so well; and
what is remarkable, I <i>was not nervous</i>, and read the speech
really well. The Tories began immediately afterwards to
conduct themselves very <i>badly</i> and to plague us. But everyone
praised you very much. Melbourne made a very fine
speech about you and your ancestors. To-day I receive the
Address of the House of Lords, and, perhaps, also that of the
House of Commons.</p>

no one has dined for the last week.</p>

people, and the Radicals will also rally round their Queen to
protect her from the Tories; but it is a curious sight to see those,
who as Tories, used to pique themselves upon their excessive loyalty,
doing everything to degrade their young Sovereign in the eyes of
the people</i>. <i>Of course there are exceptions</i>.</p>

stay at Windsor, but, dear Albert, you have not at all understood
the matter. <i>You forget, my dearest Love, that I am the
Sovereign, and that business can stop and wait for nothing.
Parliament is sitting, and something occurs almost every day, for
which I may be required, and it is quite impossible for me to be
absent from London; therefore two or three days is already a
long time to be absent</i>. <i>I am never easy a moment, if I am not
on the spot, and see and hear what is going on, and everybody,
including all my Aunts (who are very knowing in all these things),
says I must come out after the second day, for, as I must be surrounded
by my Court, I cannot keep alone</i>. <i>This is also my own

and Uncle Leopold had no right to quarter the English Arms,
but the Sovereign has the power to allow it by Royal Command:
this was done for Uncle Leopold by the Prince Regent, and I
will do it again for you</i>. <i>But it can only be done by Royal
Command</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">I will, therefore, without delay, have a seal engraved for
you.</p>

<p class="ind">You will certainly feel very happy too, at the news of the
coming union of my much-beloved Vecto<sup>5</sup> with Nemours. It
gives me quite infinite pleasure, because then I can see the dear
child more frequently.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE PRINCE'S GRANT</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Brussels</span>, <i>31st January 1840</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Victoria</span>,&mdash;I am most grateful for your long
letter of the 27th and 28th inst. I send a messenger to be able
to answer quite confidentially. I must confess that I never
saw anything <i>so disgraceful</i> than the discussion and vote in
the Commons.<sup>6</sup> The whole mode and way in which those who
opposed the grant treated the question was so extremely
<i>vulgar</i> and <i>disrespectful</i>, that I cannot comprehend the Tories.
The men who uphold the dignity of the Crown to treat their
Sovereign in such a manner, on such an occasion! Even in
private life the most sour and saturnine people relax and grow
gay and mildly disposed on occasions like this. Clearly, as
you are Queen Regnant, Albert's position is to all intents and
purposes that of a male Queen Consort, and the same privileges
and charges ought to be attached to it which were attached to
Queen Adelaide's position. The giving up the income which
the Queen-Dowager came into, and which I hope and trust
Albert would never have, or have had, any chance of having
had himself, was in reality giving up a thing which <i>custom</i> had
sanctioned. That Prince George of Denmark<sup>7</sup> was considered
to be in the same position as a Queen Consort there can be, I
think, no doubt about, and when one considers the immense
difference in the value of money then and now, it renders
matters still more striking. I must say such conduct in Parliament
I did <i>not expect</i>, and the less when I consider that your
Civil List was rather curtailed than otherwise, perhaps not
quite fairly. I rejoice to think that I induced Lord Melbourne
to propose to you not to accede to the giving up of the Duchy
of Lancaster. Parliament did not deserve it, and by good
management I think something may be made of it.</p>

<p class="ind">Another thing which made me think that Parliament would
have acted with more decency, is that I return to the country
now near &pound;40,000 a year, <i>not because</i> I thought my income <i>too
large</i>, as worthy Sir Robert Peel said, but from motives of
political delicacy, which at least might be acknowledged on
such occasions. I was placed by my marriage treaty in the
position of a Princess of Wales, which in reality it was, though
not yet by law, there existing a possibility of a Prince of Wales
as long as George IV. lived. I can only conclude by crying
<i>shame, shame</i>!...</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.215" id="pagei.215"></a>[page&nbsp;215]</span>

<p class="ind">I hope and trust you will not be too much worried with all
these unpleasant things, and that Albert will prove a comforter
and support to you. And so good-bye for to-day.

<span class="rightnote">AMIABILITY OF THE PRINCE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Brussels</span>, <i>4th February 1840</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Victoria,</span>&mdash;I have now treated all the questions
you wished me to touch upon with Albert, and I was
much pleased with his amiable disposition. At a certain distance
explanations by letter are next to impossible, and each
party in the end thinks the other unreasonable. When he
arrived he was rather exasperated about various things, and
pretty full of grievances. But our conversations have dissipated
these clouds, and now there will only remain the new
parliamentary events and consequences, which change a good
deal of what one could reasonably have foreseen or arranged.
You will best treat these questions now verbally. Albert is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.216" id="pagei.216"></a>[page&nbsp;216]</span>
quick, not obstinate, in conversation, and open to conviction
if good arguments are brought forward. When he thinks
himself right he only wishes to have it <i>proved</i> that he
<i>misunderstands</i>
the case, to give it up without ill-humour. He is
not inclined to be sulky, but I think that he may be rendered
a little melancholy if he thinks himself unfairly or unjustly
treated, but being together and remaining together, there <i>never</i>
can arise, I hope, any occasion for any disagreement even
on trifling subjects.... Ever, my dearest Victoria, your
devoted Uncle,</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Victoria</span>,&mdash;This letter will arrive when I trust
you will be most happily occupied; I don't mean therefore
to trespass on your time.</p>

<p class="ind">May Heaven render you as happy as I always wished you to
be, and as I always tried hard to see you. There is every
prospect of it, and I am sure you will be mistress in that respect
of your own <i>avenir</i>. <i>Perfect confidence</i> will best ensure and
consolidate this happiness. Our rule in poor Charlotte's time
was never to permit <i>one single day</i> to pass over <i>ein
Missverst&auml;ndniss</i>,
however trifling it might be.<sup>8</sup> I must do Charlotte
the justice to say that she kept this compact most religiously,
and at times even more so than myself, as in my
younger days I was sometimes inclined to be sulky and silently
displeased. With this rule no misunderstandings can take
root and be increased or complicated by new ones being added
to the old. Albert is gentle and open to reason; all will therefore

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: -0.7em;">"Her Royal Highness was now and then apt to give way to a high flow of animal
spirits, natural at her time of life, and from carelessness more than unkindness to ridicule
others. In one of these sallies of inconsiderate mirth, she perceived the Prince, sombre
and cold, taking no apparent notice of what was going on, or if he did, evidently displeased.
She at length spoke to him about it, and he at once manifested reluctance to join in the
conversation, saying that though he had been a tolerably apt scholar in many things, he
had yet to learn in England what pleasure was derived from the exercise of that faculty
he understood to be called "quizzing"; that he could by no means reconcile it to himself
according to any rule either of good breeding or benevolence. The tears instantly started
in her eye, and feeling at once the severity and justice of the reproof, assured him most
affectionately that, as it was the first time she had ever merited His Royal Highness's
reproof on this subject, she assured him most solemnly it should be the last."

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and has the honour to state that the House of Commons
having resumed the consideration of the Corn Laws, the debate
was closed by Sir Robert Peel, in a speech much inferior to
those which he usually makes. Mr Warburton moved an adjournment,
which caused many members to leave the House.
The motion being opposed, there were on a division 240
against adjournment, and only 125 in favour of it.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.219" id="pagei.219"></a>[page&nbsp;219]</span>

<p class="ind">Mr Warburton then by some blunder moved that the House
adjourn, which puts an end to the debate. This was eagerly
caught at by the opposite party, and agreed to. So that the
question is lost by this ridiculous termination, and it is to be
feared that it will produce much discontent in the manufacturing
class.<sup>10</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne always feared anything like a mixture of
the Stable establishments. It would have been much better
that what horses the Prince had should have been kept quite
separate, and that the horses of your Majesty's which he
should have to use should have been settled, and some plan
arranged by which they could have been obtained when
wanted. Horses to be used by one set of people and kept and
fed by another will never do. Servants and subordinate agents
in England are quite unmanageable in these respects. If they
get [matters] into their hands neither the Deity nor the Devil,
nor both together, can make them agree. Lord Melbourne
writes this in ignorance of the actual facts of the case, and
therefore it may be inapplicable.</p>

<p class="indright"><i>6th May 1840</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
Since he wrote to your Majesty, he has seen Mr Fox Maule,<sup>17</sup>
who had been at the house in Norfolk Street. He says that it
is a most mysterious affair. Lord William Russell was found
in his bed, quite dead, cold and stiff, showing that the act had
been perpetrated some time. The bed was of course deluged
with blood, but there were no marks of blood in any other
part of the room; so that he had been killed in his bed and by
one blow, upon the throat, which had nearly divided his head
from his body. The back door of the house was broken open,
but there were no traces of persons having approached the
door from without. His writing-desk was also broken open
and the money taken out, but otherwise little or nothing had
been taken away. The police upon duty in the streets had
neither heard nor seen anything during the night. In these
circumstances strong suspicion lights upon the persons in the
house, two maids and a man, the latter a foreigner<sup>18</sup> and who
had only been with Lord William about five weeks. These
persons are now separately confined, and the Commissioners of
Police are actively employed in enquiring into the affair. An
inquest will of course be held upon the body without delay.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Victoria</span>,&mdash;I received yesterday a most kind
and dear letter from your august hands. Charles,<sup>19</sup> who wanted
to cross yesterday, will have had very bad weather. He <i>is</i>
prepared not to make too long a stay in England. He dined
here on the 19th. Louise was prepared to come to dinner,
but was not quite equal to it; she therefore came after it.
He came also to see me on the 20th, before his departure for
Ostende. It is very gracious of you to have given him subsidies,
but in fact poor Feo stands more in need of it. She
really is too poor; when one thinks that they have but &pound;600
a year, and that large castles, etc., are to be kept up with it,
one cannot conceive how they manage it. It was a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.222" id="pagei.222"></a>[page&nbsp;222]</span>
generous feeling which prompted you to see Mrs Norton, and
I have been too much her friend to find fault with it. True it
is that Norton was freely accepted by her, but she was very
poor, and could therefore hardly venture to refuse him. Many
people will flirt with a clever, handsome, but poor girl, though
not marry her&mdash;besides, the idea of having old Shery<sup>20</sup> for a
grandfather had nothing very captivating. A very unpleasant
husband Norton certainly was, and one who had little tact. I
can well believe that she was much frightened, having so many
eyes on her, some of which, perhaps, not with the most amiable
expression.</p>
<span class="rightnote">PRINCESS CHARLOTTE</span>
<p class="ind">I was delighted to learn that you meant to visit poor Claremont,
and to pass there part of your precious birthday.
Claremont is the place where in younger days you were least
plagued, and generally I saw you there in good spirits. You
will also <i>nolens volens</i> be compelled to think of me, and maybe
of poor Charlotte.</p>

<p class="ind">This gives me an opening for saying a few words on this
subject. I found several times that some people had given
you the impression that poor Charlotte had been hasty and
violent even to imperiousness and <i>rudeness</i>. I can you assure
that it was <i>not so</i>; she was quick, and even violent, but I
never have seen anybody so open to conviction, and so fair
and candid when wrong. The proverb says, and not without
some truth, that ladies come always back to the first words, to
avoid any symptom of having been convinced. Generous
minds, however, do not do this; they fight courageously their
battles, but when they clearly see that they are wrong, and
that the reasons and arguments submitted to them are
<i>true</i>, they frankly admit the truth. Charlotte had eminently
this disposition; besides, she was so anxious to please me, that
often she would say: "Let it be as it may; provided you wish
it, I will do it." I always answered: "I never want anything
for myself; when I press something on you, it is from a conviction
that it is for your interest and for your good." I know
that you have been told that she ordered everything in the house
and liked to show that she was the mistress. It was not so.
On the contrary, her pride was to make me appear to my best
advantage, and even to display respect and obedience, when
I least wanted it from her. She would almost exaggerate the
feeling, to show very clearly that she considered me as her
lord and master.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.223" id="pagei.223"></a>[page&nbsp;223]</span>

<p class="ind">And on the day of the marriage, as most people suspected
her of a very different disposition, everybody was struck with
the manner in which she pronounced the promise of obedience.
I must say that I was much more the master of the house than
is generally the case in private life. Besides, there was something
generous and royal in her mind which alone would have
prevented her doing anything vulgar or ill-bred. What
rendered her sometimes a little violent was a slight disposition
to jealousy. Poor Lady Maryborough,<sup>21</sup> at all times some
twelve or fifteen years older than myself, but whom I had much
known in 1814, was once much the cause of a fit of that description.
I told her it was quite childish, but she said, "it is
not, because she is a very coquettish, dissipated woman."
The most difficult task I had was to change her manners; she
had something brusque and too rash in her movements, which
made the Regent quite unhappy, and which sometimes was
occasioned by a struggle between shyness and the necessity
of exerting herself. I had&mdash;I may say so without seeming
to boast&mdash;the manners of the best society of Europe, having
early moved in it, and been rather what is called in
French <i>de la fleur des pois</i>. A good judge I therefore was,
but Charlotte found it rather hard to be so scrutinised,
and grumbled occasionally how I could so often find fault
with her.</p>

<p class="ind">Nothing perhaps speaks such volumes as the <i>positive fact</i> of
her manners getting <i>quite changed</i> within a year's time, and
that to the openly pronounced satisfaction of the very fastidious
and not over-partial Regent. To explain how it
came that manners were a little odd in England, it is
necessary to remember that England had been for more
than ten years completely cut off from the rest of the
world....</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE QUEEN AND THE PRINCE</span>


<p class="indright"><i>28th May 1840</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2"><i>Lord Melbourne</i>.&mdash;"I have spoken to the Queen, who says
the Prince complains of a want of confidence on trivial matters,
and on all matters connected with the politics of this country.
She said it proceeded entirely from indolence; she knew it was
wrong, but when she was with the Prince she preferred talking
upon other subjects. I told Her Majesty that she should try
and alter this, and that there was no objection to her conversing
with the Prince upon any subject she pleased. My
impression is that the chief obstacle in Her Majesty's mind is
the fear of difference of opinion, and she thinks that domestic
harmony is more likely to follow from avoiding subjects likely
to create difference. My own experience leads me to think
that subjects between man and wife, even where difference
is sure to ensue, are much better discussed than avoided,
for the latter course is sure to beget distrust. I do not
think that the Baroness<sup>23</sup> is the cause of this want of
openness, though her name to me is never mentioned by
the Queen."</p>

<p class="ind2"><i>Baron Stockmar</i>.&mdash;"I wish to have a talk with you. The
Prince leans more on you than any one else, and gives you his
entire confidence; you are honest, moral, and religious, and
will not belie that trust. The Queen has not started upon a
right principle. She should by degrees impart everything to
him, but there is danger in his wishing it all at once. A case
may be laid before him; he may give some crude and unformed
opinion; the opinion may be taken and the result
disastrous, and a forcible argument is thus raised against
advice being asked for the future.</p>

<p class="ind2">"The Queen is influenced more than she is aware of by the
Baroness. In consequence of that influence, she is not so
ingenuous as she was two years ago. I do not think that the
withholding of her confidence does proceed wholly from indolence,
though it may partly arise, as the Prince suggests,
from the entire confidence which she reposes in her present
Ministers, making her inattentive to the plans and measures
proposed, and thinking it unnecessary entirely to comprehend
them; she is of necessity unable to impart their views and
projects to him who ought to be her friend and counsellor."</p>

<p class="indright"><i>11th June 1840</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and returns your Majesty many, many thanks for your letter.
Lord Melbourne was indeed most anxious to learn that your
Majesty was well this morning. It was indeed a most awful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.226" id="pagei.226"></a>[page&nbsp;226]</span>
and providential escape. It is impossible not to shudder at
the thought of it.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne thinks that it will be necessary to have an
examination of this man before such of your Majesty's confidential
servants as are of the Privy Council;<sup>25</sup> it should take
place this morning.</p>

<p class="ind">Addresses will be moved in both Houses immediately upon
their meeting.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest and most beloved Victoria,</span>&mdash;I cannot find
words <i>strong enough</i> to express to you my horror at what
happened on the 10th, and my happiness and delight to see your
escape from a danger which was really very great. In your
good little heart I hope that it made you feel grateful to God
for a protection which was very signal. It does good and is a
consolation to think that matters are not <i>quite</i> left to take care
of <i>themselves</i>, but that an all-powerful Hand guides them.</p>

<p class="ind">Louise I told the affair mildly, as it might have made too
great an impression on her otherwise. She always feels so
much for you and loves you so much, that she was rejoiced
beyond measure that you escaped so well and took the thing
with so much <i>courage</i>. That you have shown <i>great fortitude</i> is
not to be doubted, and will make a very great and good impression.
I see that the general feeling is excellent, but what
a melancholy thing to see a young man, without provocation,
capable of such a diabolical act! That attempts of that sort
took place against George III., and even George IV., one can
comprehend; but you have not only been extremely liberal, but
in no instance have you hitherto come into contact with any
popular feeling or prejudice; besides, one should think that
your being a lady would alone prevent such unmanly conduct.
It shows what an effect bad example and the bad press have.
I am sure that this act is <i>une singerie</i> of what passes in France,
that it is a fancy of some of those societies <i>de Mort aux Rois
et Souverains</i>, without knowing wherefore, merely as a sort of
fashion....</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Victoria,</span>&mdash;Your dear letter of the 19th
greatly delighted me....</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.227" id="pagei.227"></a>[page&nbsp;227]</span>

<p class="ind">Let me now add a few words on politics. The <i>secret</i> way in
which the arrangement about the arbitration of the Turco-Egyptian
affairs has been signed, the keeping out of France in
an affair so <i>near</i> it and touching its interests in various ways,
has had here a very <i>disastrous</i> effect.<sup>26</sup> I cannot disguise from
you that the consequences may be very serious, and the more so
as the Thiers Ministry is supported by the movement party,
and as <i>reckless of consequences</i> as your own Minister for Foreign
Affairs, even much more so, as Thiers himself would not be
sorry to see everything existing upset. He is strongly impregnated
with all the notions of fame and glory which belonged to
part of the Republican and the Imperial times; he would not
even be much alarmed at the idea of a Convention ruling again
France, as he thinks that <i>he</i> would be the <i>man to rule</i> the
Assembly, and has told me last year that he thinks it for
France perhaps the <i>most powerful</i> form of Government.<sup>27</sup></p>

<p class="ind">The mode in this affair ought to have been, as soon as the
Four Powers had agreed on a proposition, to communicate it
officially to France, to join it. France had but two ways, either
to join or to refuse its adhesion. If it had chosen the last, it
would have been a free decision on her part, and a secession
which had nothing offensive in the eyes of the nation.</p>

<p class="ind">But there is a material difference between leaving a company
from motives of one's own, or being <i>kicked out</i> of it. I must
beg you to speak seriously to Lord Melbourne, who is the head
of your Government, on these important affairs; they may
upset everything in Europe if the mistake is not corrected and
moderated.</p>

<p class="ind">I shall write again to you next Friday from hence, and on
Saturday, 1st August, we set off. Ever, my dearest Victoria,
your devoted Uncle,</p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 26: On the 15th of July a convention was signed in London by representatives of England,
Russia, Austria, and Prussia, offering an ultimatum to the Viceroy of Egypt. The exclusion
of France was hotly resented in Paris. Guizot, then Ambassador in London,
had been kept in ignorance of the project, but the Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston,
denied that there had been any discourtesy intended, or want of consideration shown.</p>

<p class="footnote1">Footnote 27: Louis Adolphe Thiers (1797-1877), who through the Press had contributed to the
downfall of the Bourbons, had held various Cabinet offices under Louis Philippe, and,
from March to October 1840, was for the second time Premier.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
The House of Lords lasted until eight, and Lord Melbourne
might by an exertion have got to the Palace to dinner, but as
he had the Speech, by no means an easy one, to prepare for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.228" id="pagei.228"></a>[page&nbsp;228]</span>
consideration of the Cabinet to-morrow, he thought it better
to take this evening for that purpose, and he hopes therefore
that your Majesty will excuse his not coming, which is to him
a great sacrifice to have made.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty will have probably seen by this time the
report from your Majesty's Consul at Boulogne of the mad
attempt of Louis Bonaparte.<sup>28</sup> It is rather unfortunate that
it should have taken place at this moment, as the violent and
excited temper of the French nation will certainly lead them to
attribute it to England. It will also be highly embarrassing
to the King of the French to have in his possession a member
of the family of Bonaparte and so many Bonapartists who have
certainly deserved death but whom it may not be prudent or
politic to execute.</p>


<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 28: The Prince, afterwards the Emperor Napoleon III., descended on Boulogne with
fifty-three persons, and a tame eagle which had been intended, with stage effect, to alight
on the Colonne de Napol&eacute;on. He was captured, tried for high treason, and sentenced to
perpetual imprisonment. He effected his escape, which was undoubtedly connived at
by the authorities, in 1846.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE CONVENTION OF 1828</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Wiesbaden</span>, <i>22nd September 1840</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Victoria,</span>&mdash;I was most happy in receiving this
morning per messenger your dear little letter of the 15th,
though it is grown a little elderly. The life one leads here is
not favourable to writing, which, besides, is prohibited, and
easily gives me palpitation enough to sing "<i>di tanti palpiti!</i>"
I get up at half after six and begin to drink this hot water;
what with drinking and walking one comes to ten o'clock or
half after ten for breakfast. Then I read papers and such like
things. At one o'clock I have been generally bored with some
visit or other till two o'clock. I try to finish some writing, and
then I walk and ride out till dinner-time, generally at seven.
In the evening I have written sometimes, but it certainly does
one harm. You see that there remains but little time for
writing.</p>

<p class="ind">I am most happy to find that you are well; the papers,
which don't know what to invent to lower the Funds, said that
you had been unwell on the 10th, which, God be praised! is
not at all true.</p>

<p class="ind">I pity poor Princess Augusta<sup>29</sup> from all my heart. I am
sure that if she had in proper time taken care of herself she
might have lived to a great age. I have not time to-day to
write at any length on the politics of the day, but I am <i>far from thinking</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.229" id="pagei.229"></a>[page&nbsp;229]</span>
that the French <i>acted wisely</i> in the Oriental affair. I
must say that I think the King <i>meant well</i>, but I should not
have <i>abstained</i> from the Conference as he did, though, in France,
interference with Mehemet Ali was certainly not popular. In
England much of the <i>fond</i> is logical, but the form towards
France was, and is still, harsh and insulting. I don't think
France, which these ten years behaved well, and the poor King,
who was nearly murdered I don't remember how often, deserved
to be treated so unkindly, and all that seemingly to
please the great Autocrat. We must not forget what were the
fruits of the <i>first</i> Convention of July 1828&mdash;I think the 16th or
26th of that month; I ought to remember it, as I took its
name in vain often enough in the Greek affair.</p>

<p class="ind">This first Convention brought about the battle of Navarino
and the second campaign of the Russians, which ended with, in
fact, the demise of the poor old Porte, the <i>Treaty of Adrianople</i>.<sup>30</sup>
Your Majesty was then afflicted with the age of ten, in itself a
good age, and may not remember much about it except that
in 1829 the affair about my going to Greece began, and that
your affectionate heart took some interest in that. Lord
Melbourne, however, you <i>must encourage to speak about this
matter</i>. Canning's intention was this: he said we must
remain with Russia, and by this means <i>prevent</i> mischief. The
Duke of Wellington, who came to me shooting at Claremont in
1828, really did cry, though he is not of a crying disposition,
and said "<i>by this Convention the Russians will have the power
of doing all they never would have dared to do single-handed</i>, and
shielded by this infernal Convention, it will not be in our power
<i>to stop them</i>." Russia is again in this very snug and comfortable
position, that <i>the special protection of the Porte</i> is confided
to its tender mercies&mdash;<i>la ch&egrave;vre gardant le chou</i>, the wolf the
sheep, as I suppose I must not compare the Turcs to lambs.
The Power which ruined the Ottoman Empire, which since a
hundred and forty years nearly <i>pared</i> it all round nearly in
every direction, is to be the protector and guardian of that
same empire; and we are told that it is the most scandalous
calumny to suspect the Russians to have any other than the
most humane and disinterested views! "<i>ainsi soit-il</i>," as the
French say at the end of their sermons. This part of the
Convention of the 15th of July 1840 strikes impartial people as
strange, the more so as nothing lowers the Porte so much in the
eyes of the few patriotic Turks who remain than the protection
of the arch-enemy of the concern, Russia. I beg you to read
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.230" id="pagei.230"></a>[page&nbsp;230]</span>
this part of my letter to my good and dear friend, Lord Melbourne,
to whom I beg to be kindly remembered.</p>

<p class="footnote1">Footnote 30: Under this treaty (14th September 1829) the Danubian principalities were made
virtually independent States, the treaty rights of Russia in the navigation of the Bosphorus

the treaty the terms of the Protocol of 22nd March 1829.</p>

<p class="ind">This is certainly awkward; but the latter part about Peel
is most absurd; to him I can never apply, we must do everything
but that. But for God's sake do not bring on a crisis;<sup>32</sup>
the Queen really could not go through that <i>now</i>, and it might
make her <i>seriously ill</i> if she were to be kept in a state of agitation
and excitement if a crisis were to come on; she has had already
so much lately in the distressing illness of her poor Aunt to
harass her. I beseech you, think of <i>all</i> this, and the consequences
it might cause, not only to me, but to all Europe, as
it would show our weakness in a way that would be seriously
injurious to this country.</p>


<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 31: The letter, to which this is a reply, seems not to have been preserved. The Queen's
letter, having been shown to Lord John Russell and copied by him, has hitherto been
supposed to be a letter from Lord Melbourne to Lord John Russell. <i>See</i> Walpole's
<i>Russell</i>, vol. i., chap. xiii.</p>

<p class="footnote1">Footnote 32: The Cabinet met on the 28th to consider the Oriental Question. The Government
was on the verge of dissolution, as Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell were in conflict.
The meeting was adjourned till 1st October.

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Uncle</span>,&mdash;I have unfortunately very little time
to-day, but I will try and answer your kind letters of the 13th
and 19th briefly. You know now that the sufferings of good
excellent Aunt Augusta were terminated on the 22nd of this
month. I regret her <i>very, very</i> sincerely, though for herself
we are all most thankful for the release of such unexampled
sufferings, borne with such unexampled patience. Almost
the last thing she said when she was still conscious, the day
before she died, was to Mr More (the apothecary), who wrote me
every morning a Report: "Have you written to my darling?"
Is this not touching? The Queen-Dowager had her hand in
hers when she died, and closed her eyes when all was over; all
the Family were present.</p>

<p class="ind">I have seen your letters to Palmerston, and his answer to
you, and I also send you a paper from Lord Melbourne. I
assure you that I <i>do</i> give these affairs my <i>most serious</i> attention:
it would be indeed <i>most</i> desirable if France could <i>come back to
us</i>, and I think what Metternich suggests very sagacious and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.231" id="pagei.231"></a>[page&nbsp;231]</span>
well-judged.<sup>33</sup> You must allow me to state that <i>France</i> has
<i>put herself</i> into this unfortunate state. <i>I</i> know (as I saw
<i>all</i>
the <i>papers</i>) how she was engaged to join us&mdash;and I know how
strangely she refused; I know also, that France <i>agrees</i> in the
<i>principle</i>, but only doubts the <i>efficacy</i> of the measures. Where
then is "<i>La France outrag&eacute;e</i>"? wherefore arm when there is
<i>no</i> enemy? wherefore raise the war-cry? But this has been
<i>done</i>, and has taken <i>more</i> effect than I think the French Government
<i>now</i> like; and <i>now</i> she has to undo all this and to calm
the general agitation and excitement, which is not so easy.
Still, though France is in the wrong, and <i>quite</i> in the wrong,
still <i>I</i> am most anxious, as I am sure my Government also are,
that France should be pacified and should again take her place
amongst the five Powers. I am sure she might easily do this....</p>

Eastern affairs, and is quite of my opinion....</p>

We have had the Cabinet and it has passed over quietly. We
have agreed to make a proposition to France founded upon
the communication of Prince Metternich to the King of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.232" id="pagei.232"></a>[page&nbsp;232]</span>
Belgians.<sup>35</sup> Palmerston will propose to-morrow to Neumann,<sup>36</sup>
the Prussian Minister, and Brunnow,<sup>37</sup> that he should write to
Granville, authorising him to acquaint Thiers that if France
will concur in respecting the principle of the treaty, we, without
expecting her to adopt coercive measures, will concert
with her the further course to be adopted for the purpose of
carrying the principle into effect. This is so far so good. Lord
Melbourne trusts that it will get over the present entanglement,
but of course we must expect that in a matter so complicated
and which we have not the power of immediately terminating,
further difficulties will arise.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Downing Street</span>, <i>2nd October 1840</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
We have just had another Cabinet,<sup>38</sup> which was rendered necessary
by Brunnow and the Prussian Minister refusing to concur
in what we determined yesterday without reference to their
Courts and authority from them. This makes it impossible for
us to take the step in the way we proposed, but we have now
settled that Palmerston should direct Granville to submit the
proposition to Thiers, and ask him how he would be disposed
to receive it if it were formally made to him. This, so far as
we are concerned, will have all the effect which could have been
attained in the other way.</p>

<p class="ind">Very important despatches of the 14th inst. have come from
Constantinople. The Ministers of the Porte held the last
proposition of Mehemet Ali as a positive refusal of the terms of
the Convention, and proceeded by the advice of Lord Ponsonby<sup>39</sup>
at once to divest Mehemet Ali of the Pashalik of Egypt; to
direct a blockade of the coasts both of Syria and Egypt, and
to recall the four Consuls from Alexandria. These are serious
measures, and there are despatches from Lord Beauvale<sup>40</sup>
stating that Prince Metternich is much alarmed at them, and
thinks that measures should be immediately taken to diminish
and guard against the effect which they may have in France.
Lord Melbourne humbly begs your Majesty's pardon for this
hurried scrawl upon matters of such importance, but Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.233" id="pagei.233"></a>[page&nbsp;233]</span>
Melbourne will have the opportunity of speaking to your
Majesty more fully upon them to-morrow.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Wiesbaden</span>, <i>2nd October 1840</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">... There is an idea that Mehemet Ali suffers from what one
calls <i>un charbon</i>, a sort of dangerous ulcer which, with old
people, is never without some danger. If this is true, it only
shows how little one can say that the Pashalik of Aleppo is
to decide who is to be the master of the Ottoman Empire in
Europe and Asia, the Sultan or Mehemet? It is highly probable
that if the old gentleman dies, his concern will go to
pieces; a division will be attempted by the children, but that
in the East hardly ever succeeds. There everything is personal,
except the sort of Caliphate which the Sultan possesses, and
when the man is gone, his empire <i>also goes</i>. Runjeet Singh<sup>41</sup> is
a proof of this; his formidable power will certainly go to the
dogs, though the Sikhs have a social link which does not exist
in the Egyptian concern. If we now were to set everything in
Europe on a blaze, have a war which may change totally all
that now exists, and in the midst of it we should hear that
Mehemet is no more, and his whole <i>boutique</i> broken up, would
it not be <i>really laughable</i>, if it was not <i>melancholy</i>? And still
the war <i>once raging</i>, it would no longer put a stop to it, but go
on for <i>other reasons</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">I cannot understand what has rendered Palmerston so
<i>extremely hostile to the King</i> and Government of France. A
<i>little civility</i> would have gone a great way with the French; if
in your Speech on the 11th of August some regret had been
expressed, it would have greatly modified the feelings of the
French. But Palmerston <i>likes to put his foot on their necks</i>!
<i>Now, no statesman must triumph over an enemy that is not quite
dead</i>, because people forget a real loss, a real misfortune, but
they won't forget <i>an insult</i>. Napoleon made great mistakes
that way; he hated Prussia, insulted it on all occasions, but
still <i>left it alive</i>. The consequence was that in 1813 they rose
to a man in Prussia, even children and women took arms, not
only because they had been injured, but because they had
been treated with <i>contempt</i> and <i>insulted</i>. I will here copy what
the King wrote to me lately from Paris:</p>

<p class="ind">I think it right to give you this extract, as it is written from

you will be so kind to read it or to let it be read by Lord

The King's letter to Lord Melbourne is in many respects just
and true.<sup>43</sup> The practical measure which it recommends,
namely, that Lord Granville should make to Thiers a general
proposition for settling the whole matter, is very much the same
as that which we agreed upon at the Cabinet should be adopted.
Lord Melbourne expects that this has been carried into effect,
and if it has not, Lord Melbourne has urged that it should be
done without delay.</p>

are, unfortunately, more than troublesome, they are pregnant
with danger.</p>


<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 43: The King of the Belgians had written a letter to Lord Melbourne on 1st October,

Lord John Russell has directed a Cabinet to be summoned for
to-morrow at three o'clock, at which he intends to propose
that "Instructions should be sent to Lord Granville to ascertain
from the French Government what terms France would
consider satisfactory for the immediate arrangement of the
affairs of the East."</p>

<p class="ind">That if such terms shall appear satisfactory, Mr Henry
Bulwer<sup>44</sup> or some person of similar rank should be sent to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.236" id="pagei.236"></a>[page&nbsp;236]</span>
Constantinople to urge their acceptance on the Sultan,
and that our Allies should be invited to co-operate in that
negotiation.</p>

<p class="ind">That the French Government should be informed that the
only mode in which the pacification can be carried into effect
is by Mehemet Ali's accepting the terms of the treaty and then
receiving from the Sultan the terms which shall have been
previously agreed upon by his Allies.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne feels certain that Lord Palmerston will not
accede to these proposals, and indeed Lord Melbourne himself
much doubts whether, after all that has passed, it would be
right to submit the whole matter, as it were, to the decision
and arbitration of France. Lord John Russell seems very
much determined to press this question to a decision to-morrow,
and Lord Melbourne much fears that such a decision
may lead to serious consequences.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is much grieved to have to send your
Majesty intelligence which he knows will greatly disquiet your
Majesty, but there is no remedy for it.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne's lumbago is somewhat better to-day but
not much. His being compelled to attend at the House

He has just received your Majesty's box. He will do all he

that there is any necessity on any side for a decisive step at

a great deal too short and dry and slight, but the importance

All the question at the Cabinet to-day as to whether we
should write a communication to France was fortunately put
an end to by Guizot desiring to see Palmerston in the morning
and making a communication to him. This communication
is very much in substance what Mr. Bulwer's note had led us
to expect. It is a strong condemnation of the act of the
Porte depriving Mehemet Ali of the Government of Egypt, an
expression of satisfaction at having already learned from Lord
Palmerston and Count Apponyi<sup>46</sup> that Austria and England
are not prepared to consider this act as irrevocable, and a
threat on the part of France that he considers the power of
Mehemet Ali in Egypt a constituent part of the balance of
Europe, and that he cannot permit him to be deprived of that
province without interfering. It was determined that this
intimation should be met in an amicable spirit, and that Lord
Palmerston should see the Ministers of the other Powers and
agree with them to acquaint the French that they with England
would use their good offices to induce the Porte not to
insist upon the deprivation of Mehemet Ali as far as Egypt is
concerned. Lord Melbourne hopes that this transaction may
lead to a general settlement of the whole question.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne feels himself much fatigued to-night.
Though better, he is yet far from well, and he knows by experience
that this malady when once it lays hold of him does
not easily let go. It was so when he was younger. He fears,
therefore, that it will not be prudent for him to leave town so
early as Monday, but will do so as soon as he can with safety.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston submits to your Majesty some interesting
letters, which he received some days ago from Paris,
showing that there never has been any real foundation for the
alarm of war with France which was felt by some persons in
this country.</p>

Thiers to Mons. Guizot which was communicated to him
yesterday by Mons. Guizot, and which seems to open a prospect
of an amicable and satisfactory understanding between France
and the Four Powers.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston also submits a note from Mr Bulwer
intimating that the French Government would be contented
with an arrangement which should leave Mehemet Ali in
possession of Egypt alone, without any part of Syria, and
Viscount Palmerston submits that such is the arrangement
which it would on all accounts be desirable to accomplish.
There seems reason to think that the bombardment of Beyrout<sup>47</sup>
and the deposal of Mehemet Ali by the Sultan have greatly
contributed to render the French more reasonable on this
question, by exciting in their minds an apprehension that unless
some arrangement be speedily effected, the operations now
going on in the Levant will end in the entire overthrow of
Mehemet Ali.</p>

He has not written before to-day, because he had nothing new
to lay before your Majesty. Lord Melbourne anxiously hopes
she feels some confidence that the present state of the Eastern
affairs is such as may lead to a speedy, amicable termination&mdash;at
the same time, with a nation so irritable as the French, and
with the Constitution which they have and which they are
unused to exercise, it is impossible to feel secure for a moment.
Guizot, when he gave the despatch of Thiers to Lord Palmerston,
said that he had nothing to do with the reasonings of that
despatch, and would not enter into any argument upon them.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.239" id="pagei.239"></a>[page&nbsp;239]</span>

<p class="ind">He delivered them only in his official capacity as the Ambassador
of the King of France. All he would say was that
they were the result of a great effort of that party in France
which was for peace. This was a sufficient intimation that he
himself did not approve of them, but it was not possible to
collect from what he said upon what grounds his dissent was
founded. Lord Melbourne has since heard that he says, that
he considers that France has taken too low a tone and has
made too much concession, and that he could not have been
a party to this step if he had been one of the King's Ministers.
The step is also probably contrary to the declared opinion of
M. Thiers; whether it be contrary to his real opinion is
another question. But if it was written principally by the influence
of the King, it is a measure at once bold and friendly
upon his part, and the success of which will much depend upon
its being met in an amicable spirit here.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne returns the letter of the King of the Belgians.

disposition of the King of the French, and she thinks that in
consideration of the difficulties the King has had to contend

make some return; and indeed, as Lord Palmerston states,
the arrangement proposed is the best which can be desired.</p>

he should run the risk of bringing back the complaint, if he
should leave town to-morrow.</p>

<p class="ind">He thinks it might also be imprudent in another point of
view, as affairs are still in a very unsettled state, and the rest
of the Cabinet watch with great impatience, and, to say the
truth, not without suspicion, the manner in which Palmerston
will carry into effect the decision of Saturday. They are particularly
anxious for speed, and I have written both last night
and this morning to Palmerston, to urge him not to delay.
He will go down to Windsor to-morrow, and your Majesty will
then have an opportunity of speaking to him, upon which
Lord Melbourne will write again to your Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">Guizot has been with Lord Melbourne this morning for the
purpose of repeating what he had before said to Palmerston,
that the Note which he delivered on Saturday was the result
of a great effort made by the party who are for peace, that it
had been conquered against a strong opposition, that if it were
not taken advantage of here now, it would not be renewed,
that the conduct of affairs in France would probably fall into
the hands of the violent party, and that it would be no longer
possible to control the excited feelings of the people of France.</p>

<p class="ind">The worst is that Palmerston, and John Russell, with now
the greater part of the Cabinet, proceed upon principles,
opinions, and expectations which are entirely different from
one another, and which therefore necessarily lead to a different
course of action. We are anxious to finish the business
speedily, because we fear that there is danger of the Government
of France being forced into violent measures by popular
outcry. Palmerston, on the contrary, thinks that there is no
danger of war, that the French do not mean war, and that
there is no feeling in France but what has been produced by
the Ministry and their instruments the Press.</p>

<p class="ind">We are anxious that the opportunity should be seized now
whilst we have the appearance of success in Syria, not being at
all confident of the ultimate result. Palmerston, on the contrary,
is so confident of complete success, that he wishes to
delay concluding the affair until he can have the benefit of the
full advantages, which he anticipates, in the negotiation.</p>

<p class="ind">We should be too glad to see the matter settled, leaving
Mehemet Ali in possession of Egypt.</p>

<p class="ind">Palmerston has both the wish and the hope of getting him
out of Egypt, as well as Syria.</p>

<p class="ind">These great differences of view, object, and expectation
render it difficult for those who hold them to pursue the same
line of conduct.</p>

<p class="ind">There is also, as your Majesty knows, much suspicion, distrust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.241" id="pagei.241"></a>[page&nbsp;241]</span>
and irritation, and all these circumstances throw great
obstacles in the way of the progress of affairs, but Lord

by the gravity of its consequences. But this step upon the

something conciliatory, and I hope and trust I have succeeded.
Lord Melbourne, who left Claremont on the same day as we
did, was confined to the house till yesterday, when he arrived
here, by a lumbago and bilious attack; but I had a constant
correspondence with him on this unfortunate and alarming
question, and he is, I can assure you, fully aware of the danger,
and as anxious as we are to set matters right; and so is Lord
John, and Palmerston, I hope, is getting more reasonable.
They have settled in consequence of Thiers' two despatches
that Palmerston should write to Lord Ponsonby to urge the
Porte <i>not</i> to dispossess Mehemet Ali finally of Egypt, and I
believe the other foreign Ministers at Constantinople will
receive similar instructions; this despatch Palmerston will
send to Granville (to-night, I believe) to be communicated to
Thiers, and <i>I</i> have made Palmerston <i>promise</i> to put into the
despatch to Granville "that it would be a source of great
satisfaction to England, if this would be the cause of bringing
back France to that alliance (with the other Four Powers) from
which we had seen her depart with so much regret." I hope this
will have a good effect. Now, in <i>my</i> humble opinion (but this
I say of myself and without anybody's knowledge), if France,
upon this, were to make some sort of advance, and were to
<i>cease arming</i>, I think all would do; for you see, if France goes
on arming, we shall hardly be justified in not doing the same,
and that would be very bad. Couldn't you suggest this to the
King and Thiers, as of yourself? My anxiety is great for the

show Thiers also concerning the armaments. I think that my
arguments will make some impression on Thiers. The King
writes me word that by dint of great exertion he had brought
Thiers to be more moderate. If it was possible to bring France
and Mehemet Ali to agree to the greatest part of the Treaty,
it will be worth while for everybody to consent. The way to
bring France to join in some arrangement, and to take the
engagement to compel Mehemet to accept it, would be the
best practical way to come to a conclusion. It is probable,
though I know nothing about it in any positive way, that the
efforts of getting possession of Syria will fail, if the country
itself does not take up arms on a large scale, which seems not
to be believed.</p>

<p class="ind">To conclude then my somewhat hurried argumentation,
the greatest thing is to negotiate. The negotiation cannot
now have the effect of weakening the execution as that goes
on, and it may have the advantage of covering the non-success
if that should take place, which is at all events possible if not
probable. May I beg you to read these few confused words
to Lord Melbourne as a supplement of my letter to him.
Darmes says that if Chartres had been with the King, he would
not have fired, but that his reason for wishing to kill the King
was his conviction that one could not hope for war till he was
dead.</p>

<p class="ind">It is really melancholy to see the poor King taking this
<i>acharnement</i> very much to heart, and upon my word, the other
Powers of Europe owe it to themselves and to him to do everything
to ease and strengthen his awful task.</p>

<span class="rightnote">NEWS FROM SYRIA</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Carlton Terrace</span>, <i>8th November 1840</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and in addition to the good news from Syria, which
confirms the defeat and dispersion of the forces, both of
Ibrahim and of Solyman Pasha, with the loss of 8,000 prisoners,
24 pieces of cannon, the whole of their camp, baggage, and
stores, followed by the flight of those two Generals with a small
escort, he has the satisfaction of informing your Majesty that
the new French Ministers had a majority of 68, upon the vote
for the election of the President of the Chamber.<sup>54</sup></p>

<p class="ind">This majority, so far exceeding any previous calculation,
seems to place the stability of the Government beyond a doubt,

their majority will not be so overwhelming.</p>

<span class="rightnote">DISAFFECTION IN FRANCE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>11th November 1840</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and with reference to your Majesty's memorandum of
the 9th inst., he entreats your Majesty not to believe that
there exists at present in France that danger of internal
revolution and of external war which the French Government,
to serve its own diplomatic purposes, endeavours to represent.</p>

<p class="ind">There is no doubt a large Party among the leading politicians
in France, who have long contemplated the establishment of
a virtually, if not actually, independent State in Egypt and
Syria, under the direct protection and influence of France, and
that Party feel great disappointment and resentment at finding
their schemes in this respect baffled. But that Party will not
revenge themselves on the Four Powers by making a revolution
in France, and they are enlightened enough to see that France
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.247" id="pagei.247"></a>[page&nbsp;247]</span>
cannot revenge herself by making war against the Four Powers,
who are much stronger than she is.</p>

<p class="ind">... But your Majesty may be assured that there is in
France an immense mass of persons, possessed of property, and
engaged in pursuits of industry, who are decidedly adverse to
unnecessary war, and determined to oppose revolution. And
although those persons have not hitherto come prominently
forward, yet their voice would have made itself heard, when
the question of peace or unprovoked war came practically to
be discussed.</p>

<p class="ind">With regard to internal revolution, there is undoubtedly
in France a large floating mass of Republicans and Anarchists,
ready at any moment to make a disturbance if there was no
strong power to resist them; but the persons who would lose
by convulsion are infinitely more numerous, and the National
Guard of Paris, consisting of nearly 60,000 men, are chiefly
persons of this description, and are understood to be decidedly
for internal order, and for external peace.</p>

<p class="ind">It is very natural that the French Government, after having
failed to extort concessions upon the Turkish Question, by
menaces of foreign war, should now endeavour to obtain those
concessions, by appealing to fears of another kind, and should
say that such concessions are necessary in order to prevent
revolution in France; but Viscount Palmerston would submit
to your Majesty his deep conviction that this appeal is not better
founded than the other, and that a firm and resolute perseverance
on the part of the Four Powers, in the measures which
they have taken in hand, will effect a settlement of the affairs
of Turkey, which will afford great additional security for the
future peace of Europe, without producing in the meantime
either war <i>with</i> France, or revolution <i>in</i> France.</p>

<p class="ind">France and the rest of Europe are entirely different now
from what they were in 1792. The French nation is as much
interested now to avoid further revolution, as it was interested
then in ridding itself, by any means, of the enormous and
intolerable abuses which then existed. France then imagined
she had much to gain by foreign war; France now knows
she has everything to lose by foreign war.</p>

<p class="ind">Europe then (at least the Continental States) had also a
strong desire to get rid of innumerable abuses which pressed
heavily upon the people of all countries. Those abuses have
now in general been removed; the people in many parts of
Germany have been admitted, more or less, to a share in the
management of their own affairs. A German feeling and a
spirit of nationality has sprung up among all the German people,
and the Germans, instead of receiving the French as Liberators,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.248" id="pagei.248"></a>[page&nbsp;248]</span>
as many of them did in 1792-1793, would now rise as one man
to repel a hateful invasion. Upon all these grounds Viscount
Palmerston deems it his duty to your Majesty to express his
strong conviction that the appeals made to your Majesty's
good feelings by the King of the French, upon the score of the
danger of revolution in France, unless concessions are made to
the French Government, have no foundation in truth, and are
only exertions of skilful diplomacy.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston has to apologise to your Majesty for
having inadvertently written a part of this memorandum upon
a half-sheet of paper. And he would be glad if, without inconvenience
to your Majesty, he could be enabled to read to the
Cabinet to-morrow the accompanying despatches from Lord
Granville.</p>


<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to Viscount Palmerston.</i><sup>55</sup></h5>

<span class="rightnote">THE STATE OF FRANCE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>11th November 1840</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has to acknowledge the receipt of Lord Palmerston's
letter of this morning, which she has read with great
attention. The Queen will just make a few observations upon
various points in it, to which she would wish to draw Lord
Palmerston's attention. The Queen does so with strict
impartiality, having had ample opportunities of hearing both
sides of this intricate and highly-important question.</p>

<p class="ind">First of all, it strikes the Queen that, even if M. Thiers <i>did</i>
raise the cry, which was so loud, for war in France (but which
the Queen cannot believe he <i>did</i> to the extent Lord Palmerston
does), that such an excitement <i>once</i> raised in a country like
France, where the people are more excitable than almost any
other nation, it cannot be so easily controuled and stopped
again, and the Queen thinks this will be seen in time.</p>

<p class="ind">Secondly, the Queen cannot either quite agree in Lord
Palmerston's observation, that the French Government state
the danger of internal revolution, if not supported, merely to
extract further concessions for Mehemet Ali. The Queen does
not pretend to say that this danger is not exaggerated, but depend
upon it, a <i>certain</i> degree of danger does exist, and that the
situation of the King of the French and the present French
Government is not an easy one. The majority, too, cannot be
depended upon, as many would vote against Odillon Barrot,<sup>56</sup>
who would <i>not</i> vote on other occasions with the Soult-Guizot
Ministry.</p>

<p class="ind">Thirdly, the danger of war is also doubtless greatly exaggerated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.249" id="pagei.249"></a>[page&nbsp;249]</span>
as also the numbers of the French troops. But
Lord Palmerston must recollect how very warlike the French
are, and that if once roused, they will not listen to the calm
reasoning of those who wish for peace, or think of the great
risk they run of <i>losing</i> by war, but only of the glory and of
revenging insult, as they call it.</p>

<p class="ind">Fourthly, the Queen sees the difficulty there exists at the
present moment of making any specific offer to France, but she
must at the same time repeat how <i>highly</i> and <i>exceedingly</i> important
she considers it that some sort of conciliatory agreement
should be come to with France, for she cannot believe
that the appeals made to her by the King of the French are only
exertions of skilful diplomacy. The Queen's earnest and only
wish is peace, and a maintenance of friendly relations with her
allies, consistent with the honour and dignity of her country.
She does not think, however, that the last would be compromised
by attempts to soften the irritation still existing in
France, or by attempts to bring France back to her former
position in the Oriental Question.</p>

<p class="ind">She earnestly hopes that Lord Palmerston will consider this,
will reflect upon the importance of not driving France to
extremities, and of conciliatory measures, without showing
fear (for our successes on the coast of Syria show our power),
or without yielding to threats. France has been humbled, and
France is in the wrong, but, therefore, it is easier than if we had
failed, to do something to bring matters right again. The
Queen has thus frankly stated her own opinion, which she
thought it right Lord Palmerston should know, and she is sure
he will see it is only dictated by an earnest desire to see <i>all</i> as
much united as possible on this important subject.</p>

Palmerston, <i>rex</i> and autocrat, is, for a Minister finding himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.250" id="pagei.250"></a>[page&nbsp;250]</span>
in such fortunate circumstances, far <i>too irritable and violent</i>.
One does not understand the use of showing so much hatred
and anger. What he says about the <i>appeal to the personal
feeling of the Queen, on the part of the King of the French</i>, is childlike
and malicious, for it has <i>never</i> existed.</p>

<p class="ind">The King was for many years the great friend of the Duke of
Kent, after whose death he remained a friend of Victoria. His
relations with the latter have, up to 1837, passed through very
varied phases; she was for a long time an object of hatred in
the family, who had not treated the Duke of Kent over-amicably,
and a proof of this is the fact that the Regent, from
the year 1819, forbade the Duke his house and presence&mdash;which
was probably another nail in the Duke's coffin. Many
of these things are quite unknown to Victoria, or forgotten by
her. Still it is only fair not to forget the people who were
her friends before 1837; after that date there was a violent
outbreak of affection among people who in the year 1836
would still not go near Victoria. October 1836, when he sat
next her at dinner, was the first time that Palmerston himself
had ever seen Victoria except at a distance. As you have the
best means of knowing, the King has not even dreamt of
applying to Victoria.</p>

<p class="ind">As to danger, it was very great in September, on the occasion
of the <i>ouvrier</i> riot&mdash;for a Paris mob fires at once, a thing
which&mdash;Heaven be thanked!&mdash;English mobs rarely do. Towards
the end of October, when Thiers withdrew, there was a
possibility of a revolution, and it was only the fear of people of
wealth that kept them together, and drew them towards
Guizot.</p>

<p class="ind">A revolution, at once democratic and bellicose, could not but
become most dangerous. That was on the cards, and only a
fairly fortunate combination of circumstances saved matters.
The King and my poor mother-in-law were terribly <i>low</i>, <i>on both
occasions</i>, and I confess that I looked everyday with the greatest
anxiety for the news. If the poor King had been murdered,
or even if he were now to be murdered, what danger, what confusion
would follow! All these things were met by Palmerston
with the excessively <i>nonchalante</i> declaration, <i>it was not so, and
it is not so</i>! Those are absolutely baseless assertions, and
totally valueless. At least I could estimate the danger as well
as he and Bulwer&mdash;and, indeed, it was an anxious crisis. I
should think the Revolution of 1790 <i>et ce qui s'en est suivi</i> had
done a brisk enough business in Europe, and to risk a new one
of the same kind would really be somewhat scandalous.</p>

<p class="ind">What, however, may be the future fruit of the seed of
Palmerston's sowing, we do not in the least know as yet; it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.251" id="pagei.251"></a>[page&nbsp;251]</span>
may, however, prove sufficiently full of misfortune for the
future of innocent people. The Eastern affairs will be put on
an intelligible footing only when, after these differences with
Mehemet Ali, something is done for the poor Porte, which is
now so much out of repair. Otherwise there remains a little
place which is called Sebastopol, and from which, as the wind
is almost constantly favourable, one can get very quickly to
Constantinople&mdash;and Constantinople is always the one place
which exercises the greatest influence, and all the more because
the ducats come from that quarter, with results which the
marked economy of England is hardly likely to effect....</p>

<p class="ind">Victoria has borne herself bravely and properly in the
matter, and <i>deserves to be greatly praised</i>....</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5em;">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>

<h3 style="margin-top: -0.5em;">TO CHAPTER X</h3>


<p>At the beginning of the year the Ministry were confronted with
monetary difficulties and bad trade; their special weakness in
finance, contrasted with Sir Robert Peel's great ability, in addition
to their many reverses, indicated that a change was at hand; and
confidential communications were, with Lord Melbourne's full
approval, opened up by the Prince with Sir Robert Peel, to avert the
recurrence of a Bedchamber dispute. The Ministry were defeated on
their Budget, but did not resign. A vote of want of confidence was
then carried against them by a majority of one, and Parliament was
dissolved; the Ministers appealing to the country on the cry of a
fixed duty on corn. The Conservative and Protectionist victory was
a decisive one, the most significant successes being in the city of
London, Northumberland, and the West Riding. Somewhat improving
their position in Scotland and Ireland, and just holding their
own in the English boroughs, the Whigs were absolutely overwhelmed
in the counties, and in the result three hundred and sixty-eight
Conservatives and only two hundred and ninety-two Liberals were
returned. The modern practice of resigning before meeting Parliament
had not then been introduced, and the Ministry was defeated in
both Houses on Amendments to the Address, the Duke of Wellington
taking the opportunity of eulogising Lord Melbourne's great services
to the Queen. A powerful Protectionist Ministry was formed by
Sir Robert Peel, including the Duke of Wellington, Lord Aberdeen,
Sir James Graham, and Lord Lyndhurst.</p>

<p>Great national rejoicings took place when, on the 9th of November,
a male heir to the throne, now His Majesty King Edward VII.,
was born.</p>

<p>In France the bitter feeling against England, arising out of the
Syrian expedition, still continued, but Thiers' supersession by the
more pacific Guizot, and the satisfaction with which both the latter
and his Sovereign regarded the displacement of Palmerston by
Aberdeen, began to lead to a better <i>entente</i>. The scheme of fortifying
Paris continued, however, to be debated, while the Orleanist
family were still the subjects of futile <i>attentats</i>.</p>

<p>Spain was disturbed, the question of the guardianship of the young
Queen giving rise to dissension: insurrections in the interests of the
Queen-mother took place at Pampeluna and Vittoria, and her
pension was suspended by Espartero, the Regent.</p>

<p>In the east, Mehemet Ali surrendered the whole of the Turkish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.254" id="pagei.254"></a>[page&nbsp;254]</span>
fleet, and he was subsequently guaranteed the hereditary Pashalik
of Egypt by the four European Powers who had intervened in the
affairs of the Levant.</p>

<p>In Afghanistan, an insurrection broke out, and Sir Alexander
Burnes was murdered; our envoy at Cabul, Sir William Macnaghten,
in an unfortunate moment entered into negotiations with Akbar
Khan, a son of Dost Mahommed, who treacherously assassinated
him. Somewhat humiliating terms were arranged, and the English
force of 4,000 soldiers, with 12,000 camp-followers, proceeded to
withdraw from Cabul, harassed by the enemy; after endless
casualties, General Elphinstone, who was in command, with the
women and children, became captives, and one man alone, of the
16,000&mdash;Dr Brydon&mdash;reached Jellalabad to tell the tale.</p>

<p>In China, operations were continued, Sir Henry Pottinger superseding
Captain Elliot, and Canton soon lying at the mercy of the
British arms; the new Superintendent co-operated with Sir Hugh
Gough and Admiral Sir William Parker, in the capture of Amoy,
Chusan, Chintu, and Ningpo.</p>

<p>In America, the union of the two Canadas was carried into effect,
but a sharp dispute with the United States arose out of the Upper
Canada disturbances of 1837. Some Canadian loyalists had then
resented the interference of a few individual Americans in favour of
the rebels, and an American named Durfee had been killed. One
M'Leod, a British subject, was now arrested in the State of New
York, on a charge of having been concerned in the affray. He was
acquitted, reprisals were made by Canadians, and international
feeling was for a time highly acute.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 3em;">Much interest naturally attaches to Lord Melbourne's continued
correspondence with the Queen, after the change of Government.
Baron Stockmar's remonstrance on the subject shows that he misunderstood
the character of the correspondence, and over-estimated
its momentousness.</p>

<p>These letters dealt chiefly with social and personal matters, and
although full of interest from the light which they throw on Lord
Melbourne's relations with the Queen, they show him to have
behaved with scrupulous honour and delicacy, and to have tried to
augment, rather than undermine, Peel's growing influence with the
Queen and Prince. There are comparatively few of Peel's letters in
the collection. He wrote rarely at first, and only on strictly official
matters. But before long his great natural reserve was broken
through, and his intercourse with the Prince, to whom his character
was particularly sympathetic, became very close and intimate.</p>

<p>Of all the English Ministers with whom the Prince was brought
in contact, it is known that he preferred the stately and upright
Commoner, who certainly, of all English Ministers, estimated and
appreciated the Prince's character most truly and clearly.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Uncle,</span>&mdash;I have to thank you for two very kind
letters, of the 26th December and 1st January, and for all your
very kind and good wishes. I am sorry to hear you have all
been plagued with colds; we have as yet escaped them, and I
trust will continue to do so. I think, dearest Uncle, you cannot
<i>really</i> wish me to be the "Mamma d'une <i>nombreuse</i>
famille," for I think you will see with me the great inconvenience
a <i>large</i> family would be to us all, and particularly to
the country, independent of the hardship and inconvenience to
myself; men never think, at least seldom think, what a hard
task it is for us women to go through this <i>very often</i>. God's
will be done, and if He decrees that we are to have a great
number of children, why we must try to bring them up as useful
and exemplary members of society. Our young lady flourishes
exceedingly, and I hope the Van de Weyers (who have been
here for three days), who have seen her twice, will give you a
favourable description of her. I think you would be amused
to see Albert dancing her in his arms; he makes a capital
nurse (which I do not, and she is much too heavy for me to
carry), and she already seems so happy to go to him.</p>

<p class="ind">The christening will be at Buckingham Palace on the 10th of

<span class="rightnote">THE QUEEN'S EDUCATION</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>15th January 1841</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">Lord Melbourne said, "The Prince is bored with the sameness
of his chess every evening. He would like to bring literary
and scientific people about the Court, vary the society, and
infuse a more useful tendency into it. The Queen however has
no fancy to encourage such people. This arises from a feeling
on her part that her education has not fitted her to take part in
such conversation; she would not like conversation to be
going on in which she could not take her fair share, and she is
far too open and candid in her nature to pretend to one atom
more knowledge than she really possesses on such subjects;
and yet, as the world goes, she would, as any girl, have been
considered accomplished, for she speaks German well and
writes it; understands Italian, speaks French fluently, and
writes it with great elegance. In addition to this old
Davys instilled some Latin into her during his tutorship.
The rest of her education she owes to her own natural
shrewdness and quickness, and this perhaps has not been
the proper education for one who was to wear the Crown
of England.</p>

<p class="ind2">"The Queen is very proud of the Prince's utter indifference
to the attractions of all ladies. I told Her Majesty that these
were early days to boast, which made her rather indignant. I
think she is a little jealous of his talking much even to men."</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE QUEEN'S SPEECH</span>

<p class="indright"><i>19th January 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He has just received your Majesty's letter. Lord Melbourne
is very sorry not to come down to Windsor, but he really thinks
that his absence from London at this moment might be prejudicial.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne will do his utmost to have the Speech
worded in the most calm manner, and so as in no respect to
offend or irritate any feelings. Some mention of the good
conduct and gallantry of the Navy there must be&mdash;to omit it
would be injurious and disheartening&mdash;but as to any expressions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.257" id="pagei.257"></a>[page&nbsp;257]</span>
complimentary to France or expressive of regret at our
separation from it, it will be hardly possible to introduce anything
of that nature.<sup>1</sup> It is quite unusual in our Speeches from
the Throne to express either approbation or disapprobation
of the conduct of foreign nations and foreign Governments.
It is surprising how very seldom it has been done, and the
wisdom and prudence of abstaining from it is very manifest.
It would be giving an opinion upon that which does not belong
to us. Anything which would have the effect of producing
satisfaction in France must be of an apologetic character, which
there is no ground for, and for which neither the Government
nor the country is prepared.</p>

<p class="ind">The best course will be a total reserve upon this head,
certainly abstaining from anything that can be in the slightest
degree offensive.</p>


<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 1: France was not mentioned, though the Convention with the other Powers, and the
naval operations in conjunction with Austria, were referred to.</p>

Majesty on Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is very sorry that your Majesty is compelled
to come to London contrary to your inclinations; but Lord
Melbourne much rejoices that your Majesty expresses that
reluctance, as there is no surer sign of complete happiness and
contentment in the married life than a desire to remain quietly
in the country, and there is nothing on the earth Lord Melbourne
desires more anxiously than the assurance of your Majesty's
happiness.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Brussels</span>, <i>22nd January 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Victoria</span>,&mdash;I thank you very sincerely for
your kind letter of the 19th, which I hasten to answer. I
should not have bored you by my presence, but the act of the
christening is, in my eyes, a sort of closing of the first cyclus
of your dear life. I was shooting at the late Lord Craven's
in Berkshire, when I received the messenger who brought me
the horrifying news of your poor father's deadly illness. I
hastened in bitter cold weather to Sidmouth, about two days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.258" id="pagei.258"></a>[page&nbsp;258]</span>
before his death. His affairs were so much deranged that your
Mother would have had no means even of leaving Sidmouth
if I had not taken all this under my care and management.
That dreary journey, undertaken, I think, on the 26th of
January, in bitter cold and damp weather, I shall not easily
forget. I looked very sharp after the poor little baby, then
about eight months old. Arrived in London we were very
unkindly treated by George IV., <i>whose great wish was to get you
and your Mamma out of the country</i>, and I must say without
my assistance you could <i>not</i> have remained.... I state these
facts, because it is useful to remember through what <i>difficulties</i>
and <i>hardships</i> one had to struggle. You will also remember
that though there existed the <i>possibility</i> of your eventually
succeeding to the Crown, that possibility was very doubtful,
the then Duchess of Clarence having been confined after your
Mother, and there being every reason to think that, though
poor little Princess Elizabeth did not live more than some
months, other children might appear.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p class="ind">It was a long time from 1820 to 1837! We got over it,
however, and, as far as you are concerned, God be praised!
safely and happily. You are married, with every prospect of
many happy years to come, and your happiness is <i>crowned</i>, and
<i>consolidated</i>, as it were, by the birth of the dear little lady.
Having from motives of discretion, perhaps <i>carried even too far</i>,
not assisted at your coming to the throne, nor at your Coronation,
nor afterwards at your marriage, I wished to assist at the
christening of the little Princess, an event which is of great
importance....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne will speak to Lord Palmerston about Lord

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne does not see the name of the Archbishop of
Canterbury as a subscriber to this "Parker" Society, and if
your Majesty will give him leave, he will ask him about it
before he gives your Majesty an answer. It is in some degree
a party measure, and levelled against these new Oxford
doctrines. The proposal is to republish the works of the
older divines up to the time of the death of Queen Elizabeth.
Up to that period the doctrines of the Church of
England were decidedly Calvinistic. During the reign of
James II.,<sup>4</sup> and particularly after the Synod of Dort (1618-1619),
the English clergy very generally adopted <i>Arminian</i>
opinions.</p>

<p class="ind">It is proposed to republish the works of the divines who
wrote during the first period, and to stop short when they come
to the second. There is meaning in this. But, after all, the
object is not a bad one, and it may not be worth while to consider
it so closely.</p>

and is very sorry to have to acquaint your Majesty that the
Duke of Wellington was taken ill in the House of Lords this
evening with a seizure, probably paralytic, and of the same
nature with those which he has had before. Lord Brougham,
who was standing opposite to the Duke and addressing the
House, observed the Duke's face to be drawn and distorted,
and soon afterwards the Duke rose from his seat and walked
staggeringly towards the door. He walked down the gallery,
supported on each side, but never spoke. A medical man
was procured to attend him; he was placed in his carriage and
driven home....</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel made a remarkable speech. Adverting to

that much as he disliked war, yet if the honour or interests
of the country required it, he should sink all internal differences,
and give his best support to the Government of his

<span class="rightnote">CHINA</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Foreign Office</span>, <i>10th April 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your
Majesty, and has the honour to submit the accompanying
letters, which he received yesterday, about the operations in
China, and which have just been returned to him by Viscount
Melbourne, whose letter he also transmits.<sup>6</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston has felt greatly mortified and disappointed
at this result of the expedition to China, and he much
fears that the sequel of the negotiation, which was to follow
the conclusion of these preliminary conditions, will not tend to
render the arrangement less objectionable. Captain Elliot
seems to have wholly disregarded the instructions which had
been sent to him, and even when, by the entire success of the
operations of the Fleet, he was in a condition to dictate his own
terms, he seems to have agreed to very inadequate conditions.<sup>7</sup>
The amount of compensation for the opium surrendered falls
short of the value of that opium, and nothing has been obtained
for the expenses of the expedition, nor for the debts of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.261" id="pagei.261"></a>[page&nbsp;261]</span>
bankrupt Hong<sup>8</sup> merchants. The securities which the plenipotentiaries
were expressly ordered to obtain for British residents
in China have been abandoned; and the Island of Chusan
which they were specifically informed was to be retained till
the whole of the pecuniary compensation should have been
paid, has been hastily and discreditably evacuated. Even the
cession of Hong Kong has been coupled with a condition about
the payment of duties, which would render that island not a
possession of the British Crown, but, like Macao, a settlement
held by sufferance in the territory of the Crown
of China.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston deems it his duty in laying these papers
before your Majesty, to state some few of the objections which
he feels to the arrangement, but the Cabinet will have to consider,
as soon as they meet after the Recess, what advice they
may wish humbly to tender to your Majesty upon these important
matters. There is no doubt, however, that much has
been accomplished, but it is very mortifying to find that other
things which the plenipotentiaries were ordered to obtain,
and which the force placed at their command was amply
sufficient to enable them to accomplish, have not been
attained.</p>

<p class="ind">Viscount Palmerston has sent a small map of the Canton
River, which your Majesty may like to keep for future reference.</p>


<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 6: Captain Elliot, after capturing the Chinese position at the mouth of Canton River,
concluded a preliminary treaty with the Chinese Government, which did not satisfy the
Chinese, and which was strongly disapproved of by the English Ministry, as containing
no mention of the opium traffic, which had been the cause of all the difficulties; Elliot
was accordingly recalled, and succeeded by Sir Henry Pottinger.</p>

<p class="footnote1">Footnote 7: They were the cession of Hong-Kong, and payment of an indemnity of 6,000,000
dollars to Great Britain, with provision for commercial facilities and collection of customs.</p>

a "street." Hong Kong (Hiang Kiang) means the "fragrant lagoon."</p>

<p class="ind">The Chinese business vexes us much, and Palmerston is
deeply mortified at it. <i>All</i> we wanted might have been got,
if it had not been for the unaccountably strange conduct of
Charles Elliot (<i>not Admiral</i> Elliot,<sup>9</sup> for <i>he</i> was obliged to come
away from ill-health), who completely disobeyed his instructions

<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.262" id="pagei.262"></a>[page&nbsp;262]</span>
was very gallantly done by the Marines, and immense destruction
of the Chinese took place.<sup>10</sup> The accounts of the
cruelty of the Chinese to one another are horrible. Albert is
so much amused at my having got the Island of Hong Kong,
and we think Victoria ought to be called Princess of Hong Kong
in addition to Princess Royal.</p>

<span class="rightnote">ARMY DISCIPLINE</span>
<p class="ind">We have had under our consideration at the Cabinet the
unfortunate subject of the conduct of Lord Cardigan.<sup>13</sup> The
public feeling upon it is very strong, and it is almost certain
that a Motion will be made in the House of Commons for an
Address praying your Majesty to remove him from the command
of his regiment. Such a Motion, if made, there is very
little chance of resisting with success, and nothing is more to
be apprehended and deprecated than such an interference of
the House of Commons with the interior discipline and government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.263" id="pagei.263"></a>[page&nbsp;263]</span>
of the Army. It was also felt that the general order issued
by the Horse Guards was not sufficient to meet the case, and in
these circumstances it was thought proper that Lord Melbourne
should see Lord Hill, and should express to him the opinion of
the Cabinet, that it was necessary that he should advise your
Majesty to take such measures as should have the effect of
removing Lord Cardigan from the command of the 11th Hussars.
The repeated acts of imprudence of which Lord Cardigan
has been guilty, and the repeated censures which he has drawn
down upon himself, form a ground amply sufficient for such a
proceeding, and indeed seem imperiously to demand it.<sup>14</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne has seen Lord Hill and made to him this
communication, and has left it for his consideration. Lord Hill
is deeply chagrined and annoyed, but will consider the matter
and confer again with Lord Melbourne upon it to-morrow.</p>

cashiered for writing him a challenge; he sent a coarse and insulting verbal message to
another, and then punished him with prolonged arrest, because he respectfully refused
to shake hands with the officer who had been employed to convey the affront; he fought
a duel with a lieutenant who had left the corps, and shot him through the body; and he
flogged a soldier on Sunday, between the Services, on the very spot where, half an hour
before, the man's comrades had been mustered for public worship."&mdash;<span class="sc">Sir G. Trevelyan</span>,

shooting a Captain Harvey Garnett Phipps Tuckett. He had accused Tuckett of being
the author of letters which had appeared in the papers reflecting on his character; a duel
on Wimbledon Common followed, and Tuckett was wounded. The evidence, consisting
in part of a visiting card, showed that a Captain Harvey Tuckett had been wounded,
which was held to be insufficient evidence of identity.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He is most anxious upon all subjects to be put in possession of
Your Majesty's full and entire opinions. It is true that this
question may materially affect the discipline of the Army, by
subjecting the interior management of regiments to be brought
continually under the inspection and control of the House of
Commons upon complaints of officers against their superiors,
or even of private men against the officers.</p>

<p class="ind">The danger of the whole of Lord Cardigan's proceedings has
been lest a precedent of this nature should arise out of them.
The question is whether it is not more prudent to prevent a
question being brought forward in the House of Commons,
than to wait for it with the certainty of being obliged to yield
to it or of being overpowered by it. But of course this cannot
be done unless it is consistent with justice and with the usage
and prestige of the Service.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne has desired the Cabinet Ministers to assemble
here to-day at four o'clock, in order to consider the
subject. Lord Melbourne has seen Lord Hill again this morning,
and Lord Hill has seen and consulted the Duke of Wellington,
who has stated his opinion very fully.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.264" id="pagei.264"></a>[page&nbsp;264]</span>

<p class="ind">The opinion of the Duke is that the Punishment on Sunday
was a great impropriety and indiscretion upon the part of
Lord Cardigan, but not a Military offence, nor a breach of the
Mutiny Act or of the Articles of War; that it called for the
censure of the Commander-in-Chief, which censure was pronounced
by the General Order upon which the Duke was consulted
before it was issued, and that according to the usage
of the Service no further step can be taken by the Military

<span class="rightnote">THE NOTTINGHAM ELECTION</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">South Street</span>, <i>28th April 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He has himself seen the result of the election at Nottingham<sup>15</sup>
without the least surprise, from his knowledge of the place and
his observation of the circumstances of the contest. What
John Russell reported to your Majesty was the opinion of
those who act for us in that place, but as soon as Lord Melbourne
saw that there was a disposition upon the part of the
violent party, Radicals, Chartists, and what not, to support
the Tory candidate, he knew that the contest was formidable
and dubious. The Tory party is very strong, naturally, at
Nottingham, and if it received any accession of strength, was
almost certain to prevail. This combination, or rather this
accession of one party to the Tories, which has taken place at
Nottingham, is very likely, and in Lord Melbourne's opinion
almost certain, to take place in many other parts of the
country in the case of a general election, and forms very serious
matter for consideration as to the prudence of taking such a
step as a dissolution of the Parliament.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne will wait upon your Majesty after the
Lev&eacute;e. It signifies not how late, as there is no House of
Lords.</p>

forward the Budget in a remarkably clear and forcible
speech.</p>

<p class="ind">The changes in the duties on Sugar and Timber,<sup>16</sup> and the
announcement made by Lord John Russell of a proposal for
a fixed duty on Corn, seemed to surprise and irritate the

and satisfied himself with attacking the Government
on the state of the finances.</p>

<p class="ind">The supporters of the Government were greatly pleased with
Mr Baring's plan, and loud in their cheers.</p>

<p class="ind">It is the general opinion that Lord Stanley will not proceed
with his Bill,<sup>17</sup> and there seems little doubt of this fact.</p>

<p class="ind">But the two parties are now evenly balanced, and the absence
or defection of some two or three of the Ministerial party may
at any time leave the Government in a minority.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
We decided at the Cabinet on Friday that we could not sanction
the agreement which Captain Elliot has probably by this time
concluded with the Government of China, but that it would
be necessary to demand a larger amount of indemnity for the
past injury, and also a more complete security for our trade
in future. For this purpose it was determined to send out
instructions, in case the armament should not have left the
Chinese coasts and have been dispersed, to reoccupy the Island
of Chusan,<sup>18</sup> a measure which appears to have had a great
effect upon the minds of the Chinese Government. It was
also determined to recall Captain Elliot, and to send out as
soon as possible another officer with full instructions from
hence as to the views and intentions of your Majesty's Government.
Sir Henry Pottinger,<sup>19</sup> an officer in the East India
Company's Service, much distinguished in the recent operations
in Afghanistan, is designated with your Majesty's approbation
for this service, which he has signified his willingness to undertake.
It was also thought that it would be proper to entrust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.266" id="pagei.266"></a>[page&nbsp;266]</span>
Lord Auckland<sup>20</sup> with general discretionary powers as to the
further conduct of the expedition. These determinations
Lord Melbourne hopes that your Majesty will approve.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell informed Lord Melbourne yesterday that
he knew that it was not the intention of the Opposition to press
Lord Stanley's Bill; but it is not to be expected in the present
position of affairs that they will not determine upon taking
some decisive and united measure in advance.</p>

<p class="ind">In the present state of public measures and of public feeling,
when debate may arise at any moment, it would not be fitting
for Lord Melbourne to absent himself on any sitting day
from the House of Lords. But unless there should be anything
so urgent as to prevent him, he will come down after
the House on Tuesday evening and stay until Thursday
morning.</p>

<p class="ind">Fanny is highly delighted and immeasurably grateful for
your Majesty's offer of the Lodge in Richmond Park, and most
desirous to avail herself of your Majesty's kindness, and so is
Jocelyn. Lord Melbourne has little doubt that they will
thankfully accept it.<sup>21</sup></p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My beloved Victoria,</span>&mdash;As you know surely already, the
day of yesterday went off very well. The christening<sup>22</sup> was
very splendid, the weather beautiful, and everything extremely
well managed.... The arrival at Notre-Dame, and the <i>coup
d'&oelig;il</i> of the old church, all hung interiorly with crimson velvet
draperies and trophies of flags, was very splendid. There was
in the church three rows <i>de tribunes</i> all full of well-dressed
people. <i>Les grands corps de l'&Eacute;tat &eacute;taient rang&eacute;s de chaque c&ocirc;t&eacute; et
dans le ch&oelig;ur; l'Autel &eacute;tait plac&eacute; au centre de l'&eacute;glise. Les
cardinaux et tout le clerg&eacute; &eacute;taient alentour</i>. When my father
arrived, the Archbishop of Paris received him at the door of
the church, and we all walked in state. My father <i>ouvrait la
marche</i> with the Queen. <i>Prie-dieu</i> and chairs were disposed
for us <i>en demi-cercle</i> before the altar, or rather before the
baptismal font, which was placed in front of it, in the very
middle of the Church. My father and mother stood in the
centre of the row near each other. Your uncle, Chartres, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.267" id="pagei.267"></a>[page&nbsp;267]</span>
all the Princes followed on the side of my father, and the
princesses on the side of my mother. Paris remained with
H&eacute;l&egrave;ne till the moment of the christening. When the ceremony
began he advanced near the font with my father and
mother (sponsors), and was taken up in the arms of his nurse.
After the christening a Mass and <i>Te Deum</i> were read, and when
we came back to the Tuileries the <i>corps municipal</i> brought the
sword which the City of Paris has given to the Comte de
Paris....</p>

<span class="rightnote">A MINISTERIAL CRISIS</span>

<h5><i>"The Ministry in jeopardy." (Heading in the Prince Albert's hand.)</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>4th May 1841</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">Lord Melbourne came down from town after the House of
Lords. I went with him to his room for an hour after the
Queen had retired. He said the main struggle would take
place on the Sugar Duties on Friday. His impression was that
the Government would be beat, and he must then decide
whether to go out or dissolve. He leaned to the former. I
said, "I trusted he would not dissolve unless he thought there
was some prospect of increasing his strength, and begged him
to remember what was done would not be considered the
act of the Government but that of himself and the Queen,
and that he individually would be held as the responsible
person."</p>

<p class="ind2">He said he had not written to the Queen to prepare H.M. for
coming events and the course that it would be incumbent upon
her to take, for he felt it extremely difficult and delicate,
especially as to the use she should make of the Prince, and of
her mode of communication when she required it with Lord
Melbourne. He thought she ought never to ask his advice
direct, but if she required his opinion there would be no
objection to her obtaining it through the Prince.</p>

<p class="ind2">He said H.M. had relied so implicitly upon him upon all
affairs, that he felt that she required in this emergency advice
upon almost every subject. That he would tell H.M. that she
must carefully abstain from playing the same part she did,
again, on Sir R. Peel's attempt to form a Ministry, for that nothing
but the forbearance of the Tories had enabled himself and
his colleagues to support H.M. at that time. He feared Peel's
doggedness and pertinacity might make him insist, as a point
of honour, on having all discretion granted to him in regard to
the removal of Ladies. I told him of the Prince's suggestion
that before the Queen saw Sir R. Peel some negotiation might
be entered into with Sir Robert, so that the subject might be
avoided by mutual consent, the terms of which might be
that Sir Robert should give up his demand to extort the
principle. The Queen, on the other hand, should require
the resignation of those Ladies objected to by Sir Robert.
Lord Melbourne said, however, that the Prince must not
have personal communication with Sir Robert on this
subject, but he thought that I might through the medium
of a common friend.</p>

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Memorandum by Mr Anson.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">LORD MELBOURNE'S ADVICE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>5th May 1841</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">Saw Lord Melbourne after his interview this morning with
the Queen. He says Her Majesty was perfectly calm and
reasonable, and seemed quite prepared for the resignation of
the Government. He said she was prepared to give way upon
the Ladies if required, but much wished that that point might
be previously settled by negotiation with Sir R. Peel, to avoid
any discussion or difference. Lord Melbourne thinks I might
do this. He would also like Peel to be cautioned not to press
Her Majesty to decide hastily, but to give Her Majesty time,
and that he should feel that if he acted fairly he would be met
in the same spirit by the Queen.</p>

<p class="ind2">With regard to future communication with Lord Melbourne,
the Queen said she did not mean that a change should exclude
her from Lord Melbourne's society, and when Lord Melbourne
said that in society Her Majesty could not procure Lord
Melbourne's opinion upon any subject, and suggested that
that should be obtained through the Prince, Her Majesty said
that that could pass in writing under cover to me, but that she
must communicate direct.</p>

<p class="ind2">The Queen, he says, leans to sending for the Duke of Wellington.
Lord Melbourne advised that Her Majesty should make
up her mind at once to send for Sir Robert. He told me that
it would not be without precedent to send for both at once;
this it appears to me would obviate every objection. The
Queen, he thinks, has a perfect right to exercise her judgment
upon the selection of all persons recommended to Her Majesty
for Household appointments, both as to liking, but chiefly as
to their character and as to the character of the husband or
wife of the person selected. He would advise the Queen to
adopt the course which King William did with Lord Melbourne
in 1835, viz. desiring Lord Melbourne, before His Majesty
approved of any appointments, to send a list of those proposed
even to the members of every Board, and the King having
them all before him expressed his objections to certain persons,
which Lord Melbourne yielded to.</p>

<p class="ind2">Told Lord Melbourne that the Prince wished him to impress
upon the Queen's mind not to act upon the approaching crisis
without the Prince, because she would not be able to go through
difficulties by herself, and the Prince would not be able to help
her when he was ignorant of the considerations which had
influenced her actions. He would wish Lord Melbourne when
with the Queen to call in the Prince, in order that they might
both be set right upon Lord Melbourne's opinions, that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.270" id="pagei.270"></a>[page&nbsp;270]</span>
might express in the presence of each other his views, in order
that he should not convey different impressions by speaking to
them separately, so that <i>they</i> might act in concert.</p>

<p class="ind2">The Prince says the Queen always sees what is right at a
glance, but if her feelings run contrary she avoids the Prince's
arguments, which she feels sure agree with her own, and seeks
arguments to support her wishes against her convictions from
other people.</p>



<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">DISSOLUTION OR RESIGNATION</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">South Street</span>, <i>7th May 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and laments much the prospect that lies before us, more especially
as it is so repugnant to your Majesty's feelings. Your
Majesty has often observed that these events must come in
the course of affairs at some moment or another, but Lord
Melbourne knows not whether it is much consolation to reflect
that what is very disagreeable is also natural and unavoidable.
Lord Melbourne feels certain that your Majesty will consider
the situation calmly and impartially, will do that which shall
appear the best for your own interests and those of the country,
which are identical.</p>

<p class="ind">Everything shall be done that can be; the questions which
may arise shall be considered well, and upon as full information
as can be obtained. But Lord Melbourne has little to add
to what he wrote to your Majesty yesterday. So many interests
are affected by this Sugar question, the West Indian,
the East Indian, the opponents of Slavery and others, that
no small number of our supporters will be induced either to
stay away or to vote against us, and this must place us in a
minority upon the main points of our Budget. In this we can
hardly acquiesce, nor can we adopt a different policy and propose
other taxes, when in our opinion the necessary revenue
can be raised without imposing them. This state of things
imposes upon us the alternative of dissolution or of resignation,
and to try the former without succeeding in it would be to
place both your Majesty and ourselves in a worse situation
than that in which we are at present.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">South Street</span>, <i>8th May 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
We have been considering this question of dissolution at the

Cabinet, and we have had before us a general statement of the
public returns for England and Wales. It is not very favourable,
but Lord Melbourne fears that it is more favourable than
the reality would prove. The Chancellor,<sup>23</sup> Palmerston, and
Hobhouse are strongly for dissolution, but the opinion of the
majority is the other way, and in that opinion Lord Melbourne
is strongly inclined to agree.</p>

<h5><span class="sc">Notes upon an Interview with Sir Robert Peel</span> (No. 1).<sup>24</sup></h5>

<p class="indright"><i>9th May 1841</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">Told Sir Robert that I had wished to have sought him
through the medium of a common friend, which would have
given him a greater confidence than I had now a right to expect
at his hands, but I felt upon so delicate a mission it was
safer, and would be more in accordance with his wishes, to
come direct.</p>

<p class="ind2">That the Prince had sent me to him, with the object of
removing difficulties upon his coming into office.</p>

<p class="ind2">That Her Majesty was anxious that the question of the
removal of the Ladies of the Bedchamber should not be revived,
and would wish that in any personal communication
with Sir Robert this question might be avoided.</p>

<p class="ind2">That it might be arranged that if Sir Robert would not insist
upon carrying out his principle, Her Majesty might procure
the resignation of any Ladies whom Sir Robert might object
to; that I thought there might be a disposition to yield to the
removal of the Mistress of the Robes, Lady Normanby, and
the Duchess of Bedford, as being connected with leading
political persons in Government.</p>

<p class="ind2">Endeavoured to impress upon Sir Robert that if he acts
fairly and kindly towards the Queen, he will be met in the
same spirit.</p>

<p class="ind2">Sir Robert said he had considered the probable object of
my interview, and thought, from my former position with
Lord Melbourne, that Lord Melbourne would be aware of my
coming. He must be assured of this before he could speak
confidentially to me.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.272" id="pagei.272"></a>[page&nbsp;272]</span>

<p class="ind2">Upon this I admitted that Lord Melbourne had knowledge
of my intention, but that I was not authorised to say that he
had.</p>

<p class="ind2">Sir Robert said, "I shall put aside all form, and treat you
frankly and confidentially. You may depend upon every
word you say being held as sacred. No part, without further
permission, shall be mentioned even to the Duke, much less to
any of my other colleagues.</p>

<p class="ind2">"<i>I would waive every pretension to office, I declare to God!
sooner than that my acceptance of it should be attended with any
personal humiliation to the Queen</i>."</p>

<p class="ind2">He thought that giving in the names of those Ladies whom
he considered obnoxious was an offensive course towards the
Queen.</p>

<p class="ind2">For the sake of office, which he did not covet, he could not
concede any constitutional principle, but it was not necessary
that that principle should be mooted.</p>

<p class="ind2">"It would be repulsive to my feelings that Her Majesty
should part with any of her Ladies, as the <i>result of a forced
stipulation on my part</i>; in a party sense it would doubtless
be advantageous to me to say that I had demanded from the
Queen, and the Queen had conceded to me the appointments
of these three Ladies."</p>

<p class="ind2">The mode he would like, and which he considered as least
objectionable for Her Majesty, was for Her Majesty to say to
him, "There is no occasion to revive this constitutional question,
as those ladies immediately connected with prominent
members of the Administration have sent in their resignation."</p>

<p class="ind2">The vacancies existing before Sir Robert Peel sees Her
Majesty, there is no necessity for discussion.</p>

<p class="ind2">On the one hand, by this means, there was less appearance
of insult to the Queen, and on the other, there was no appearance
of concession of principle upon his.</p>

<p class="ind2">Sir Robert was ready to make any personal sacrifice for Her
Majesty's comfort, except that of his honour. "Can the Queen
for an instant suppose that I would permit my party to urge
me on to insist upon anything incompatible with Her Majesty's
dignity, which it would be my great aim and honour to defend?"</p>

<p class="ind2">[This was his indignant reply to my remark upon the rumours
that his party would press him to coerce and subdue Her
Majesty.]</p>

<p class="ind2">Sir Robert thinks it better for the Queen to avoid anything
in the shape of a stipulation. He would like what he would
have done upon a former occasion (and upon which, on the
honour of a gentleman, his views had undergone no change)
to be taken as a test of what he would be ready to concede to.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.273" id="pagei.273"></a>[page&nbsp;273]</span>

<p class="ind2">Nothing but misconception, he said, could in his opinion
have led to failure before. "<i>Had the Queen told me</i>" (after
the question was mooted, which it never need have been)
"<i>that those three ladies immediately connected with the Government
had tendered their resignation, I should have been perfectly
satisfied</i>, and should have consulted the Queen's feelings in
replacing them."</p>

<p class="ind2">Sir Robert said this conversation shall remain sacred, and
to all effect, as if it had never happened, until he saw me
again to-morrow morning.</p>

<p class="ind2">There is nothing said, he added, which in any way pledges
or compromises the Queen, the Prince, or Lord Melbourne.</p>

<p class="indright"><i>10th May 1841</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">Peel said: "It is essential to my position with the Queen
that Her Majesty should understand that I have the feelings
of a gentleman, and where my duty does not interfere, I cannot
act against her wishes. Her Majesty doubtless knows how
pressed I am as the head of a powerful party, but the impression
I wish to create in Her Majesty's mind is, that I am
bound to defend her against their encroachments."</p>
<span class="rightnote">HOUSEHOLD APPOINTMENTS</span>
<p class="ind2">In regard to Household appointments the holders of which
are not in Parliament, he had not considered the question, but
in the meantime he would in no way commit himself to anyone,
or to any understanding upon the subject, without previous
communication. He had no personal objects to serve,
and the Queen's wishes would always be consulted.</p>

<p class="ind2">He again repeated, that if the Queen's personal feelings
would suffer less by forming an Administration to his exclusion,
he should not be offended. Private life satisfied him, and he
had no ambition beyond it.</p>

<p class="ind2">Lord Melbourne might rest assured that <i>he</i> fully appreciated
his aim, that his only object was to do that which was most for
Her Majesty's advantage, and no human being should know
that he was privy to this overture. Lord Melbourne might
depend upon his honour. If Lord Melbourne was pressed to
a dissolution he should still feel the same impression of Lord
Melbourne's conduct, that it was honourable and straightforward.</p>

<p class="ind2">The Queen considers it her right (and is aware that her predecessors
were peculiarly tenacious of this right) to appoint
her Household. She, however, gives up the great officers of
State and those of her Lords-in-Waiting, Equerries, and
Grooms-in-Waiting, who are <i>in Parliament</i>, to the appointment
of the Prime Minister, subject to her approval.</p>

<p class="ind2">The Queen has <i>always</i> appointed her <i>Ladies of the Bedchamber
herself</i>, but has generally mentioned their names to
the Prime Minister before appointing them, in order to leave
him room for objection in case he should deem their appointment
injurious to his Government, when the Queen would
probably not appoint the Lady.</p>

<p class="ind2">The Maids of Honour and Women of the Bedchamber are
of course not included amongst those who are mentioned to
the Prime Minister before their appointment, but are at once
appointed by the Queen.</p>

<p class="indright"><i>Wednesday, 12th May 1841</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">"At seven minutes to five Lord Melbourne came to me and
stayed till half-past five. He gave me the copies of Anson's
conversations with Peel. Lord Melbourne then gave me a
letter from the Chancellor to read, strongly advocating a dissolution,
and wishing that there should be a division also on
Lord John Russell's amendment.<sup>26</sup></p>

<p class="ind2">"Lord Melbourne left the letter with me. The first part of
the letter, relative to Lord John's amendment, we think good,
but the other part we can't quite agree in. 'There is to be
a Cabinet to-morrow to consider what is to be done,' said Lord
Melbourne, 'for the Chancellor's opinion must be considered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.275" id="pagei.275"></a>[page&nbsp;275]</span>
There is a preferment amongst our people for dissolution,'
Lord M. added. The feeling in the country good. I asked
Lord M., 'Must they resign directly, the next day, after the
division (if they intended resigning)?' 'Why,' he said, 'it
was awkward <i>not</i> to do so if Parliament was sitting; if the
division were only to take place on Friday, then they needn't
announce it till Monday,' which we hope will be the case, as we
agreed it wouldn't do for me to have a ball the day Lord M.
had resigned, and before I had sent for anybody else, and
therefore I hoped that it could be managed that the division
did not take place till Friday. Lord M. said that in case they
resigned, he wished Vernon Smith<sup>27</sup> to be made a Privy Councillor;
the only addition to the Peers he mentioned the other
day he wished to make is Surrey;<sup>28</sup> we agreed that too many
Peers was always a bad thing."</p>

John Russell,' he said, 'would pursue quite a different course;
he would then announce the Sugar Duties at once. I (Lord
Melbourne) said, that I had been considering well the whole
question, and the Chancellor's letter, but that altogether I did
not think it advisable to have recourse to a dissolution&mdash;and
I think the greater part lean towards that opinion; but there
<i>are</i> a few who are very much for a dissolution&mdash;the Chancellor
and Hobhouse very much so, and Palmerston. They have,
however, not quite finally decided the matter. I understand
the debate will certainly go over to-night,' he said, 'and that

<p class="ind2">"Lord Melbourne came to me at twenty minutes past one,
and we talked about this question of dissolution. 'We shall
have a long debate upon it this morning at the Cabinet,' Lord
Melbourne said. 'The worst thing is, that if we carry the
Sugar Duties, we must dissolve. If we were to dissolve,' he
continued, 'and were to have the parties equal as they are now,
it would be very bad; if we <i>were</i> to have a <i>majority</i>, it would be
a great thing; <i>but</i> if we were to have a minority it would be
still worse.... We know that Charles I. and Charles II., and
even Cromwell, appealed to the country, and had a Parliament
returned into their very teeth' (so strong an Opposition),
'and that produced deposition, and convulsion, and bloodshed
and death; but since then the Crown has always had a
majority returned in favour of it. Even Queen Anne,' he continued,
'who removed Marlborough in the midst of his most
glorious victories and dissolved Parliament, had an immense
majority, though her measures were miserable; William IV.,'
he said, 'even though he had a majority against him which
prevented him from keeping his Ministers, had a much stronger
feeling for him in that Parliament, than he ever had before.
But I am afraid,' he added, 'that for the first time the Crown
would have an Opposition returned smack against it; and
that would be an affront to which I am very unwilling to
expose the Crown.' This is very true."</p>

<p class="ind"><i>Nous savons tous des paroles sur cet air</i>, as the French say.
I was convinced that Lord Melbourne's right and good feeling
would make him pause before he proposed to you a dissolution.
A general election in England, when great passions must be
roused or created to render it efficacious for one party or
another, is a dangerous experiment, always calculated to shake
the foundations on which have hitherto reposed the great
elements of the political power of the country. Albert will be
a great comfort to you, and to hear it from yourself has given
me the sincerest delight. His judgment is good, and he is mild
and safe in his opinions; they deserve your serious attention;
young as he is, I have really often been quite surprised how
quick and correct his judgment is....</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Wilton Crescent</span>, <i>16th May 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and has the honour to state that the general effect of last week's
debate<sup>29</sup> has been greatly in favour of the measures of your
Majesty's Ministers.</p>

<p class="ind">The speeches of Mr Labouchere, Sir George Grey, and Lord
Howick, with the powerful argument of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer on Friday night, have not been met by any corresponding
ability on the other side.</p>

<p class="ind">In fact the Opposition seem to have concealed their own
views of policy, and to have imagined that the Anti-Slavery
feeling would carry them through successfully. But this
expectation has been entirely disappointed; debate has unmasked
the hollow pretence of humanity, and the meetings at
Exeter Hall and in the country have completely counteracted
the impressions which Dr Lushington's speech<sup>30</sup> had produced.</p>

<p class="ind">Lancashire, Cheshire, and the West Riding of Yorkshire
have been roused to strong excitement by the prospect of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.278" id="pagei.278"></a>[page&nbsp;278]</span>
reduction of the duty on corn. Several of the large towns have
expressed their opinions without distinction of party.</p>

<p class="ind">These symptoms are said to have created some dissensions
among the opponents of your Majesty's present Government.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel, Lord Stanley, and nearly all the eminent
leaders of the party, profess their adherence to the principles of
Mr Huskisson.<sup>31</sup> On the other hand, the Duke of Buckingham,<sup>32</sup>
with many Lords and Commoners, is opposed to any relaxation
of the present Corn Laws. This difference must ultimately
produce serious consequences, and it is possible they may break
out before the present debate is ended.</p>

<p class="ind">One consequence of the propositions of the Ministry is the
weakening of the power of the Chartists, who have relied on the
misrepresentation that neither Whigs nor Tories would ever
do anything for the improvement of the condition of the working
classes.</p>

<p class="ind">All these circumstances have a bearing on the question of a
dissolution of Parliament, and are to be weighed against the
risks and inconveniences of so bold a measure.</p>

<p class="ind2">"Lord Melbourne came to me at twenty minutes to three.
There were no <i>new</i> news. He gave me a letter from the Duke
of Roxburgh,<sup>33</sup> saying he could not support Government on the
Corn Laws, and writing an unnecessarily cold letter. Lord
Melbourne fears this would lose Roxburgh in case of an election.
A great many of the friends of the Government, however, are
against any alteration in the Corn Laws. Talked of the excellent
accounts from the country with which the papers are
full, and I said I couldn't help thinking the Government would
gain by a dissolution, and the feeling in the country so strong,
and daily increasing. They would lose the counties, Lord
Melbourne thinks, and the question is whether their successes
in the manufacturing towns would be sufficient to counterbalance
that. The debate may last longer, Lord Melbourne
says, as J. Russell says he will continue it as long as their
friends wish it. Many of their friends would be very angry if we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.279" id="pagei.279"></a>[page&nbsp;279]</span>
did not dissolve, Lord Melbourne says. 'I say always,' said
Lord Melbourne, 'that your Majesty will be in such a much
worse position' (if a majority should be returned against us),
'but they say not, for that the others would dissolve.' I said
that if that was so we <i>must dissolve</i>, for then that it would come
to just the same thing, and that that changed my opinion very
much. 'You would like us then to make the attempt?' Lord
Melbourne asked. I said 'Almost.' I asked if he really
thought they would dissolve. 'I've great reason to believe they
would,' he replied. 'Hardinge<sup>34</sup> told Vivian<sup>35</sup> "we shall prevent
<i>your</i> dissolving, but <i>we shall</i> dissolve."' ... I asked did
Lord Melbourne think they (the Conservatives) would remain
in long, and Melbourne said: 'One can't tell beforehand what
may happen, but you would find their divisions and dissensions
amongst themselves sufficient to prevent their staying
in long.' ...</p>

<p class="ind2">"Saw Lord John Russell, who didn't feel certain if the debate
would end to-night. Talked of the very good feeling in the
country. He said he understood Sir Edward Knatchbull<sup>36</sup>
was exceedingly displeased at what Peel had said concerning
Free Trade, and said in that case Peel would be as bad as the
present Government. He thinks the Tories, if in power,
might try and collect the Sugar duties without Law, which
would do them a great deal of harm and be exceedingly unpopular.
He does <i>not</i> think the Tories intend <i>certainly</i> to
dissolve. He thinks they would not dissolve now, and that
they would hereafter get so entangled by their own dissensions,
as to render it unfavourable to them."</p>

whether it will even finish to-night, this being the eighth night,
it having begun on Friday the 7th, two Saturdays and two
Sundays having intervened! Our plans are so unsettled that
I can tell you nothing, only that you may depend upon it

an assertion, as I know your liberal feelings, and your interest
in my welfare and in that of the country too well to think you
could wish for such a thing, and I immediately said I was sure

something which might imply interest in my present

<p class="indright"><i>Tuesday, 18th May 1841</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">"Saw Lord Melbourne.<sup>37</sup> He said Lord John Russell had
been to see him, and, 'He now wishes us not to resign, but to
give notice immediately of a Motion on the Corn Laws. This,
he thinks, will make the others propose a vote of confidence, or
make them oppose the Sugar Duties, which, he thinks, will be
better for us to resign upon, and when it would be clear to our
people that we couldn't dissolve. Everybody says it would
be a very bad thing for us to resign now, upon such a question
as this, and we must consider the party a little.' I said, of
course, this would be agreeable to me as it gave us another
chance. I said it would be awkward if they resigned Thursday,
on account of the Birthday. Lord Melbourne said I could
wait a day and only send for Peel on Saturday, that that
wouldn't signify to Peel, as he could come down to Claremont.... I
asked, in case they meant to bring on this Corn Law
question, when would they do so. 'Perhaps about the 30th,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.281" id="pagei.281"></a>[page&nbsp;281]</span>
Lord Melbourne said. It would be a more dangerous question,
but it would make them (the Tories) show their colours, which
is a great advantage. He said they prevented Sir Edward
Knatchbull from speaking last night."</p>

<p class="indright" style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>Wednesday, 19th May</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">"At twenty minutes to one came Lord Melbourne.... I
returned him Lord John Russell's letter, and talked of it, and
of John Russell's saying the division and Peel's speech made
it absolutely necessary to decide <i>to-day</i> whether to <i>resign</i> or
<i>dissolve</i>. I asked what Peel had said in his speech about the
Corn Laws. 'I'll tell you, Ma'am, what he said,' Lord Melbourne
replied, 'that he was for a sliding duty and not for a
fixed duty; but he did not pledge himself as to what rate of
duty it should be. I must say,' Lord Melbourne continued, 'I
am still against dissolution. I don't think our chances of
success are sufficient.' I replied that I couldn't quite believe
that, but that I might be wrong. Lord John is for dissolving.
'<i>You</i> wish it?' I said I always did. Talked of the feeling
in the City and in the country being so good. Lord Melbourne
don't think so much of the feeling in the country. Talked of
the majority of thirty-six having not been more than they
expected.... Lord Melbourne said people thought the debate
was lengthened to please me. I said not at all, but that it was
more convenient for me. Anyhow I need do nothing till
Saturday. The House of Commons was adjourned to the
next day, and the House of Lords to Monday. 'Mr Baring
says,' he said, 'if there was only a majority one way or
another, it would be better than this state of complete
equality.'</p>

<p class="ind2">"At twenty minutes past four Lord Melbourne returned.
'Well, Ma'am,' he said, 'we've considered this question, and
both the sides of it well, and at last we voted upon it; and there
were&mdash;the Lord Chancellor for dissolution, Lord Minto<sup>38</sup> for it,
Lord Normanby against it, but greatly modified; Lord John
for, Lord Palmerston for, Lord Clarendon for, Lord Morpeth
for, Lord Lansdowne for, Labouchere for, Hobhouse for, Duncannon<sup>39</sup>
for, Baring for, Macaulay for; and under those circumstances
of course I felt I could not but go with them.<sup>40</sup>
Lord Melbourne was much affected in saying all this. 'So we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.282" id="pagei.282"></a>[page&nbsp;282]</span>
shall go on, bring on the Sugar Duties, and then, if things are
in a pretty good state, dissolve. I hope you approve?' I said
I did highly ... and that I felt so happy to keep him longer.
'You are aware we may have a majority against us?' he said;
he means in our election. The Sugar Duties would probably
take a fortnight or three weeks to pass, and they would dissolve
in June and meet again in October. He thought they must."</p>

<span class="rightnote">FEELING IN FRANCE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Brussels</span>, <i>20th May 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Victoria</span>,&mdash;I receive this very moment your
dear letter of the 18th, and without loss of time I begin my
answer here, though the messenger can only go to-morrow.
I cannot <i>sufficiently</i> express to you my <i>gratitude</i> for the
frankness
with which you have written to me&mdash;and let me entreat
you, whenever you have anything <i>sur le c&oelig;ur</i>, to <i>do the same</i>. I
shall begin with your postscript concerning the idea that I
wished your present Ministers to retire, because they had
become disagreeable to France. The people who <i>avancent
quelque chose de la sorte</i> probably have some ill-natured motive
which it is not always easy to guess; perhaps in the present
instance does it mean, let us say, <i>that?</i> whatever opinion he
may then express we can easily counteract it, representing it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.283" id="pagei.283"></a>[page&nbsp;283]</span>
as the result of <i>strong partiality to France</i>. Let us therefore
examine what France has to gain in a change of Administration.
Certainly your present Ministers are <i>not</i> much loved
<i>now</i> in France, not so much in consequence of the political
events of last year themselves, than for the <i>manner</i> in which
they came to pass. Nevertheless, when I was at Paris, King
and Council were decided to sign the treaty with the four other
Powers, which would put an end to the <i>isolement</i>, though many
people are stoutly <i>for the isolement</i>. There end the relations
which will exist for some time between the two countries&mdash;they
will be on <i>decent</i> terms; that is all I wish for the present, and
it is matter of moonshine who your Ministers are. No doubt,
formerly there existed such a predilection in favour of Lord
Grey's<sup>42</sup> Administration and those who continued it, that the
coming in of the Tories would have been considered as a great
public calamity; but even now, though this affection is gone,
the Tories will also be looked on with some suspicion. Lord
Melbourne's Administration has had the great merit of being
liberal, and at the same time prudent, conservative in the good
sense of the word, preserving what was good. Monarchy, by
an adherence to this system, was very safe, and the popular
liberal cry needless.</p>

<p class="ind">I regret that the Corn question was brought forward somewhat
abruptly;<sup>43</sup> it is a dangerous one, as it roused the most
numerous and poorest classes of society, and may easily degenerate
into bloodshed. The dissolution under such circumstances
would become still more a source of agitation, as it
generally always is in England. Lord Melbourne, I am sure,
will think so too.</p>

<p class="ind">I am delighted by what you say of Albert; it is just the
proper line for him to take, without biassing you either way,
to show you honestly the consequences which in his opinion
the one or the other may have. As he has really a very clear
and logical judgment, his opinion will be valuable for you.
I feel very much for you, and these Ministerial complications
are of a most painful and perplexing nature, though less in
England than on the Continent, as the thing is at least better
understood. To amuse you a little, and to prove to you how
impartial I must be to be in this way accused by both parties,
I must tell you that it is said in France that, conjointly with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.284" id="pagei.284"></a>[page&nbsp;284]</span>
Lord Melbourne, we <i>artfully</i> ruined the Thiers Administration,<sup>44</sup>
to the great detriment of the honour and welfare of France.
But what is still stranger is, that the younger branches of the
family, seeing that my arrival at Paris was delayed from time
to time, became convinced that <i>I would not come at all</i>, and that
my intention was to <i>cut them completely</i>, not to <i>compromettre</i>
myself with England! Truly people are strange, and the
unnecessary suspicions and stories which they love to have,
and to tell, a great bore....</p>

<p class="ind">Pray have the goodness of giving my <i>kindest</i> regards to
Lord Melbourne. I will love him very <i>tenderly</i> in and out of
office, as I am really attached to him. Now last, though first,
I offer my sincerest wishes on the happy return of your birthday;
may every blessing be always bestowed on your beloved
head. You possess <i>much</i>, let your warm and honest heart
<i>appreciate</i> that. Let me also express the hope that you always
will maintain your <i>dear character true</i> and <i>good</i> as it is, and let
us also humbly express the hope that our warmth of feeling, a
valuable gift, will not be permitted to grow occasionally a little
violent, and particularly not against your uncle. You may
pull Albertus by the ear, when so inclined, but be never irritated
against your uncle. But I have <i>not to complain</i> when other
people do not instigate such things; you have always been
kind and affectionate, and when you look at my deeds for you,
and on behalf of you, these twenty-two years, I think you will
not have many hardships to recollect. I am happy to hear of
my god-daughter's teeth, and that she is so well. May God
keep the whole dear little family well and happy for ever. My
dearest Victoria, your devoted Uncle,</p>

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Memorandum of Mr Anson's last secret interview with Sir R. Peel.</i> (No. 4.)</h5>

<span class="rightnote">SIR ROBERT PEEL</span>

<p class="indright"><i>Sunday, 23rd May 1841</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">Called upon Sir Robert Peel this morning. I said I could
not feel satisfied without seeing him after the very unexpected
course which political affairs had taken. I wished to know
that he felt assured, though I trusted there could be no doubt
upon his mind, that there had been perfect honesty of purpose
on my part towards him, and more especially upon the part of
those with whose knowledge I had been acting. I assured Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.285" id="pagei.285"></a>[page&nbsp;285]</span>
Robert that H.M. had acted in <i>the most perfect fairness towards
him</i>, and I was most anxious that there should be no erroneous
impression upon his mind as to the conduct of either H.M. or
the Prince.</p>

<p class="ind2">I said (quoting the Prince's expression), "that the Queen has
a natural modesty upon her constitutional views, and when she
receives an advice from men like the Lord Chancellor, Lord
John Russell, Mr Baring, Mr Labouchere, and Lord Clarendon,
and knows that they have been weighing the question through
so many days, she concludes that her judgment cannot be
better than theirs, and that she would do wrong to reject their
advice."</p>

<p class="ind2">The Prince, I said, however strongly impressed for or against
a question, thinks it wrong and impolitic, considering his age
and inexperience and his novelty to the country, to press upon
the Queen views of his own in opposition to those of experienced
statesmen. Sir Robert said he could relieve my mind entirely;
that he was convinced that all that had taken place had been
with the most perfect honesty; that he had no feeling whatever
of annoyance, or of having been ill-used; that, on the contrary,
he had the feeling, and should always retain it, of the deepest
gratitude to the Queen for the condescension which Her
Majesty had been pleased to show him, and that it had only
increased his devotion to Her Majesty's person. He said that
much of the reserve which he had shown in treating with me was
not on <i>his own</i> account, but that he felt from his own experience
that events were by no means certain, and he most cautiously
abstained from permitting her Majesty in any way to commit
herself, or to bind herself by any engagement which unforeseen
circumstances might render inconvenient. Sir Robert said it
was very natural to try and remove obstacles which had before
created so much confusion, and he was convinced that they
would have been practically removed by what had passed.
He said that neither Lord Stanley nor Sir James Graham knew
a word of what had passed. That Mr Greville had asked his
friend Mr Arbuthnot whether some understanding had not
been entered into between Lord Melbourne and him. That
Mr Arbuthnot had replied that he was certain that nothing of
the sort could have passed,<sup>45</sup> as, if it had, Sir Robert Peel would
have informed him (Mr Arbuthnot) of the fact. Again, Lady
de Grey, the night of the ball at the Palace, came up to him and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.286" id="pagei.286"></a>[page&nbsp;286]</span>
said the Duke of Bedford had been speaking to her about the
resignation of the Duchess of Bedford, and asking her whether
she thought it necessary. She volunteered to find out from
Sir Robert whether he thought it requisite. She asked the
question, which Sir Robert tried to evade, but not being able,
he said it struck him that if it was a question of doubt the best
means of solving it, was for the Duke of Bedford to ask Lord
Melbourne for his opinion.</p>

<p class="ind2">I added that if the dissolution was a failure, which it was
generally apprehended would be the case, I felt convinced that
Sir Robert would be dealt with in the most perfect fairness by
Her Majesty.</p>


<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 45: "After I had been told by the Duke of Bedford that Peel was going to insist on
certain terms, which was repeated to me by Clarendon, I went to Arbuthnot, told him
Melbourne's impression, and asked him what it all meant. He said it was all false, that
he was certain Peel had no such intentions, but, on the contrary, as he had before assured
me, was disposed to do everything that would be conciliatory and agreeable to the Queen."&mdash;<i>Greville's
Journal</i>, 19th May 1841.</p>



<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">VOTE OF WANT OF CONFIDENCE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">South Street</span>, <i>24th May 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and has to acquaint your Majesty that in the House of Commons
this evening Sir Robert Peel gave notice that on Thursday
next he would move a resolution to the following effect: "That
Her Majesty's Ministers not possessing power sufficient to carry
into effect the measures which they considered necessary, their
retention of office was unconstitutional and contrary to usage."<sup>46</sup>
These are not the exact words, but they convey the substance.
This is a direct vote of want of confidence, and Lord Melbourne
would be inclined to doubt whether it will be carried, and if it
is, it certainly will not be by so large a majority as the former
vote. When the Chancellor of the Exchequer moved the resolution
upon the Sugar Duties, Sir Robert Peel seconded the
motion, thereby intending to intimate that he did not mean to
interfere with the Supplies. This course was determined upon
at a meeting held at Sir R. Peel's this morning.</p>


<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 46: The closing words of the resolution were as follows: "... That Her Majesty's
Ministers do not sufficiently possess the confidence of the House of Commons to enable
them to carry through the House measures which they deem of essential importance
to the public welfare, and that their continuance in office under such circumstances is
at variance with the spirit of the Constitution."</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and has the honour to state that Sir Robert Peel yesterday
brought forward his motion in a remarkably calm and temperate
speech.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.287" id="pagei.287"></a>[page&nbsp;287]</span>

<p class="ind">Sir John Hobhouse and Mr Macaulay completely exposed
the fallacy of his resolution, and successfully vindicated the
government. Lord Worsley<sup>47</sup> declared he would oppose the
resolution, which declaration excited great anger, and produced
much disappointment in the Tory party.</p>

<p class="ind">If the debate is carried on till next week, it is probable the
Ministers may have a majority of one or two.</p>

<p class="ind">The accounts from the country are encouraging.</p>

<p class="ind">It does not appear that Sir Robert Peel, even if he carries
this motion, intends to obstruct the measures necessary for a
dissolution of Parliament.</p>

<p class="ind">... I beg you <i>not</i> to be alarmed about what is to be done;
it is <i>not</i> for a Party triumph that Parliament (<i>the longest</i> that
has sat for <i>many</i> years) is to be dissolved; it is the fairest and
most constitutional mode of proceeding; and you may trust
to the moderation and prudence of my whole Government that
nothing will be done without due consideration; if the present
Government get a majority by the elections they will go on
prosperously; if not, the Tories will come in for a short time.
The country is quiet and the people very well disposed. I am
happy, dearest Uncle, to give you these quieting news, which I
assure you are <i>not</i> partial....</p>



<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>The King of the Belgians to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">KING LEOPOLD'S VIEWS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Laeken</span> <i>31st May 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Victoria</span>,&mdash;Your Mother<sup>48</sup> is safely arrived,
though she was received close to Ostende by a formidable
thunderstorm. I had given directions that everywhere great
civilities should be shown her. She stood the fatigues better
than I had expected, and is less sleepy than in England. She
seems to be pleased with her <i>s&eacute;jour</i> here, and inclined in fact
to remain rather than to go on; but I am sure, when once in
Germany she will be both pleased and interested by it. It will
amuse you to hear from herself her own impressions.</p>

<p class="ind">I cannot help to add a few political lines. I regret much, I
must confess, that the idea of a dissolution has gained ground,
and I will try to show in a very few words why I am against it.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.288" id="pagei.288"></a>[page&nbsp;288]</span>

<p class="ind">In politics, a great rule ought to be to rule with the things which
one <i>knows already</i>, and not to jump into something entirely
new of which no one can do more <i>than guess the consequences</i>.
The present Parliament has been elected at a moment most
favourable to the present Administration after a most popular
accession to the throne, everything new and fresh, and with the
natural fondness of the great mass of people, a change is always
popular; it was known that you were kindly disposed towards
your Ministers, everything was therefore <i>&agrave; souhait</i> for the
election of a new Parliament. In this respect Ministers have
nothing like the favourable circumstances which smiled upon
them at the last general election. Feeling this, they raise a
cry, which may become popular and embarrass their antagonists
about <i>cheap</i> bread! I do not think this is quite befitting
their dignity; such things do for revolutionaries like Thiers,
or my late Ministers.... If the thing rouses the people it may
do serious mischief; if not, it will look awkward for the Ministers
themselves. If you do not grant a dissolution to your present
Ministers you would have, at the coming in of a new Administration,
the right to tell them that they must go on with the
present Parliament; and I have no doubt that they could do
so. The statistics of the present House of Commons are well
known to all the men who sit in it, and to keep it a few years
longer would be a real advantage.</p>

<p class="ind">You know that I have been rather maltreated by the Tories,
formerly to please George IV., and since I left the country,
because I served, in their opinion, on the revolutionary side of
the question. I must say, however, that for your service as
well as for the quiet of the country, it would be good to give
them a trial. If they could not remain in office it will make
them quieter for some time. If by a dissolution the Conservative
interest in the House is too much weakened the permanent
interests of the country can but suffer from that. If, on the
contrary, the Conservatives come in stronger, your position will
not be very agreeable, and it may induce them to be perhaps
less moderate than they ought to be. I should be very happy
if you would discuss these, my <i>hasty</i> views, with Lord Melbourne.
I do not give them for more than what they are, mere
<i>practical</i> considerations; but, as far as I can judge of the question,
if I was myself concerned I should have no dissolution;
if even there was but the very <i>banale</i> consideration, <i>qu'on sait
ce qu'on a, mais qu'on ne sait nullement ce qu'on aura</i>. The
moment is not without importance, and well worthy your
earnest consideration, and I feel convinced that Lord Melbourne
will agree with me, that, notwithstanding the great
political good sense of the people in England, the machine is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.289" id="pagei.289"></a>[page&nbsp;289]</span>
so complicated that it should be handled with great care and
tenderness.</p>

<p class="ind">To conclude, I must add that perhaps a permanent duty on
corn may be a desirable thing, but that it ought to be sufficiently
high to serve as a real protection. It may besides
produce this effect, that as it will be necessary, at least at first,
to buy a good deal of the to be imported corn with <i>money</i>, the
currency will be seriously affected by it. The countries which
would have a chance of selling would be chiefly Poland in all its
parts, Prussia, Austria, and Russia, the South of Russia on the
Black Sea, and maybe Sicily. Germany does not grow a
sufficient quantity of wheat to profit by such an arrangement;
it will besides not buy more from England for the present than
it does now, owing to the Zollverein,<sup>49</sup> which must first be
altered. But I will not bore you too long, and conclude with
my best love to little Victoria, of whom her Grandmama
speaks with raptures. Ever, my dearest Victoria, your devoted
Uncle,</p>

<p class="footnote1">Footnote 49: After the fall of Napoleon, the hopes of many Germans for a united national Germany
were frustrated by the Congress of Vienna, which perpetuated the practical independence
of a number of German States, as well as the predominance within the Germanic confederation
of Austria, a Power largely non-German. One of the chief factors in the
subsequent unification of Germany was the Zollverein, or Customs Union, by which
North Germany was gradually bound together by commercial interest, and thus opposed
to Austria. The success of this method of imperial integration has not been without
influence on the policies of other lands.</p>

without cunning, and Lord Melbourne can easily understand
his eagerness that the Queen should not prorogue Parliament

upon such occasions. George III. went himself in 1784; he
did not go in 1807, because he had been prevented from doing so

<span class="rightnote">LORD BROUGHAM</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Grafton Street</span>, <i>19th June 1841</i>.</p>
<span class="rightnote">LETTER FROM LORD BROUGHAM</span>
<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Most gracious Sovereign</span>,&mdash;I crave leave humbly to
approach your Majesty and to state in writing what I should
have submitted to your Royal consideration at an Audience,
because I conceive that this course will be attended with less
inconvenience to your Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">In the counsel which I ventured with great humility, but
with an entire conviction of its soundness, to tender, I cannot
be biassed by any personal interest, for I am not a candidate
for office; nor by any Parliamentary interest, for I have no
concern with elections; nor by any factious interest, for I am
unconnected with party. My only motive is to discharge the
duty which I owe to both the Crown and the country. Nor am
I under the influence of any prejudice against your Majesty's
servants or their measures; for I charge your Majesty's servants
with nothing beyond an error, a great error, in judgment,
and I entirely approve of the measures which they have lately
propounded (with a single exception partially applicable to one
of them), while I lament and disapprove of the time and manner
of propounding them, both on account of the Government and
of the measures themselves.</p>

<p class="ind">I feel myself, Madam, under the necessity of stating that the
dissolution of the Parliament appears to me wholly without
justification, either from principle or from policy. They who
advise it must needs proceed upon the supposition that a
majority will be returned favourable to the continuance of the
present Administration and favourable to their lately announced
policy. On no other ground is it possible that any
such advice should be tendered to your Majesty. For no one
could ever think of such a proceeding as advising the Crown
to dissolve the Parliament in order to increase the force of the
Opposition to its own future Ministers, thus perverting to the
mere purposes of party the exercise of by far the most eminent
of the Royal prerogatives; and I pass over as wholly unworthy
of notice the only other supposition which can with any
decency be made, when there is no conflict between the two
Houses, namely, that of a dissolution in entire ignorance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.294" id="pagei.294"></a>[page&nbsp;294]</span>
national opinion and for the purpose of ascertaining to which
side it inclines. Your Majesty's advisers must, therefore,
have believed, and they must still believe, that a majority will
be returned favourable both to themselves and their late policy.
I, on the other hand, have the most entire conviction that there
will be a considerable majority against them, and against their
policy a majority larger still, many of their supporters having
already joined to swell that majority. Whoever examines the
details of the case must be satisfied that the very best result
which the Government can possibly hope for is a narrow
majority against them&mdash;an event which must occasion a
second dissolution by whatever Ministry may succeed to the
confidence of your Majesty. But those best acquainted with
the subject have no doubt at all that the majority will be much
more considerable.</p>

<p class="ind">I beg leave, Madam, humbly to represent to your Majesty, in
my own vindication for not having laid my opinion before your
Majesty as soon as I returned from the Continent, that when I
first heard of the course taken by the Government early in May,
I formed the opinion which I now entertain, but conceived
that I must have mistaken the facts upon which they were
acting; and when I arrived twelve days ago I was confirmed
in the belief (seeing the fixed resolution taken to dissolve) that
I must have been under an erroneous impression as to the probable
results of the elections. But I have since found ample
reason for believing that my original conviction was perfectly
well founded, and that no grounds whatever exist sufficient to
make any one who considers the subject calmly, and without
the bias of either interest or prejudice, really believe that this
ill-fated proceeding can have any other result than lasting
injury to your Majesty's service, to the progress of sound and
just views of policy, and to the influence of those in whom the
Crown and the country alike should repose confidence.</p>

<p class="ind">That a number of short-sighted persons whose judgments
are warped by exclusive attention to a single subject, or by
personal feelings, or by party views (and these narrow and
erroneous), may have been loudly clamorous for the course apparently
about to be pursued, is extremely possible, and affords
no kind of excuse for it. Many of these will be the slowest to
defend what they have so unfortunately called for; some will
be among the first to condemn it when a manifest failure shall
have taken place, and general discomfiture shall throw a few
local successes into the shade.</p>

<p class="ind">My advice is humbly offered to your Majesty, as removed
far above such confined and factious views; as the parent of
all your people; as both bound and willing to watch over their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.295" id="pagei.295"></a>[page&nbsp;295]</span>
true interests; and as charged by virtue of your exalted office
with the preservation of the public peace, the furtherance of
the prosperity, and the maintenance of the liberties of your
subjects.</p>

<p class="ind">I am, with profound respect, Madam, your Majesty's faithful
and dutiful Subject,</p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 58: Mention has been made earlier of the resentment which Brougham cherished against
his late colleagues, after his exclusion from the Whig Cabinet, and this letter, on the
proposal to dissolve Parliament, was, no doubt, prompted by that feeling.</p>

<p class="footnote1">Footnote 59: Parliament, however, notwithstanding this rescript of Lord Brougham, was dissolved,
and the Ministry went to the country with the cry of a fixed duty on corn, as against a
sliding scale, and they attacked, as monopolists, at once the landowner, who enjoyed
protection for his wheat, and the West Indian proprietor, who profited by the duty on
foreign sugar. The Conservatives impugned the general policy of the Whig Administration.
The result, a majority of seventy-six, was an even greater Conservative triumph
than the most sanguine of the party anticipated.&mdash;<i>See</i> Introductory Note, <i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#pagei.253" style="font-weight: normal;">253.</a></p>

<span class="rightnote">VISIT TO WOBURN</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Woburn Abbey</span>, <i>27th July 1841</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">Arrived here last night with the Prince and the Queen;
this is now the second expedition (Nuneham being the first)
which Her Majesty has taken, and on neither occasion has the
Baroness accompanied us.</p>

<p class="ind2">The Prince went yesterday through a review of the many
steps he had made to his present position&mdash;all within eighteen
months from the marriage. Those who intended to keep him
from being useful to the Queen, from the fear that he might
ambitiously touch upon her prerogatives, have been completely
foiled; they thought they had prevented Her Majesty
from yielding anything of importance to him by creating distrust
through imaginary alarm. The Queen's good sense, however,
has seen that the Prince has no other object in all he seeks
but a means to Her Majesty's good. The Court from highest
to lowest is brought to a proper sense of the position of the
Queen's husband. The country has marked its confidence in
his character by passing the Regency Bill <i>nem</i>. <i>con</i>. The
Queen finds the value of an active right hand and able head
to support her and to resort to for advice in time of need.
Cabinet Ministers treat him with deference and respect. Arts
and science look up to him as their especial patron, and they
find this encouragement supported by a full knowledge of the
details of every subject. The good and the wise look up to
him with pride and gratitude as giving an example, so rarely
shown in such a station, of leading a virtuous and religious life.</p>

<span class="rightnote">LORD MELBOURNE AND THE GARTER</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>7th August 1841</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">I went to Lord Melbourne this morning in his room as he had
desired me. He said: "The Prince has been urging me to accept
the Blue Riband before I quit office, and I wished to tell you
that I am very anxious that this should not be pressed upon me
by the Queen; it may be a foolish weakness on my part, but
I wish to quit office without having any honour conferred upon
me; the Queen's confidence towards me is sufficiently known
without any public mark of this nature. I have always disregarded
these honours, and there would be an inconsistency in
my accepting this. I feel it to be much better for my reputation
that I should not have it forced upon me. Mr Pitt never
accepted an order, and only the Cinque Ports on being pressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.297" id="pagei.297"></a>[page&nbsp;297]</span>
to do so. Lord Grenville accepted a peerage, but never any
other honour or advantage, and I wish to be permitted to retire
in like manner. If I was a poor man, I should have no hesitation
in receiving money in the shape of place or pension; I
<i>only don't wish</i> for place, because I do not <i>want</i> it."</p>

<p class="ind2">In the course of conversation Lord Melbourne said that he
considered it very improbable that he should ever again form
a part of any Administration.</p>

<p class="ind2">He did not think that a violent course was at all to be apprehended
from Lord John Russell; he said Lord John had
been far more of a "finality" man than he had, and in the
Cabinet had always been averse to violent change. He added,
"I think you are in error in forming the opinion which you
have of him."</p>

<p class="ind2">Lord Melbourne thought the Queen very much disliked being
talked <i>at</i> upon religion; she particularly disliked what Her
Majesty termed a <i>Sunday face</i>, but yet that it was a subject far
more thought of and reflected upon than was [thought to be?]
the case.</p>

<p class="ind">... Lord Melbourne well knows the feeling which your
Majesty describes. The expectation of an event which is
dreaded and deprecated, and yet felt to be certain and imminent,
presents itself continually to the mind and recurs at
every moment, and particularly in moments of satisfaction and
enjoyment. It is perhaps no consolation to be told that events
of this nature are necessary and incidental to your Majesty's
high situation, but Lord Melbourne anxiously hopes that the
change, when it does take place, will not be found so grievous
as your Majesty anticipates, and your Majesty may rely that
Lord Melbourne will do everything in his power to reconcile it
to your Majesty's feelings.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>23rd August 1841</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">Lord John Russell was staying at the Castle, and asked to-day
for an audience of Her Majesty, and was closeted for a long
time. The Prince asked Her Majesty what Lord John came
for. The Queen said he came about several things, but
particularly he wished to impress upon the Queen that Her
Majesty should not allow Sir Robert Peel to propose any new
Grants in Parliament, as they (the Whigs) could not well oppose
it, and this being felt, the whole unpopularity would fall
upon the Queen's person. An idea existed that the Tories
were always jobbing with money, and the grant for the building
the new stables at Windsor had shown how suspicious people
were.</p>

<p class="ind2">Lord John did not speak clearly out, but on consultation
with Lord Melbourne the Queen thought Lord John must have
alluded to Peel having spoken equivocally at the end of his
speech relative to the Prince's annuity, and would now probably
propose a further grant, and would say the time was now
come in order to stand well with the Queen. The Queen
replied that she would never allow such a thing to be proposed
and that it would be a disgrace to owe any favour to that
Party.</p>

<p class="ind2">The only answer the Prince gave was that these views were
<i>very agreeable</i> for him.</p>

<span class="rightnote">DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">South Street</span>, <i>24th August 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
We have just delivered the Speech in the House of Lords, and
the debate will commence at five o'clock. We understand that
the amendment is to be a repetition of the motion of want of
confidence, which Sir Robert Peel made in the House of
Commons before the dissolution, and nearly in the same terms.
It is to be moved by Lord Ripon<sup>67</sup> in the House of Lords, and
by Mr. Stuart Wortley<sup>68</sup> in the House of Commons. It is
understood to be their intention to avoid, as much as possible,
debate upon the Corn Laws, and upon the other topics in the
Speech, and to place the question entirely upon the result of the
General Election and the proof which that affords that the
Ministry does not possess the confidence of the country. Lord
Melbourne thinks that it will not be found easy to repress
debate in the House of Commons, but would not be surprised
if the course which it is intended to pursue should much
shorten it in the House of Lords. Lord Melbourne will write
again to your Majesty after the debate, and will certainly come
down to-morrow, unless anything unexpected should occur to
prevent him.</p>

<p class="ind">It will be necessary to receive the address of the Convocation
in some manner or another. Lord Melbourne will
write confidentially to the Archbishop<sup>69</sup> to learn how it may
be received in the quietest manner and with the least
trouble. Lord Melbourne has little doubt that the Lords and
Commons will send their addresses by the officers of the
Household.</p>

spirits.</p>

The debate will probably terminate in the House of Commons
to-night; at the same time it may not. If it does we must
place our resignation in your Majesty's hands on Saturday,

Monday. Your Majesty will then do well not to delay sending

upon your Majesty to-day, but he feels that his presence is in
some degree material at a meeting, at which not only the
present situation of your Majesty's servants, but also their
future conduct and prospects, will be considered.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is sure that your Majesty will at once perceive
that it would not have a good appearance if he were to
return to Windsor immediately after having announced his
resignation to the House of Lords on Monday next.</p>

<p class="ind">It is right that there should be no appearance of delay or of
unwillingness to carry into effect the wishes of both Houses
of Parliament, and, therefore, your Majesty will forgive Lord
Melbourne if he suggests that it would be well if your Majesty
could make up your mind to appoint Sir R. Peel on Monday
next, so that there might be as little delay as possible in the
formation of a new Government. On all accounts, and
particularly on account of the lateness of the Season, it is
desirable that this should be done as speedily as possible.</p>

of trouble and annoyance is, but if the first gloom is

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>29th August 1841</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">Lord Melbourne is to take his farewell audience of the
Queen to-morrow, and Her Majesty has appointed Sir Robert
Peel to come down here at three o'clock to-morrow.</p>
<span class="rightnote">DELAY UNDESIRABLE</span>
<p class="ind2">I went with Lord Melbourne from luncheon to his room.
He seemed in tolerable spirits, though somewhat sad when he
alluded to taking leave of the Queen. He said he was anxious
that Her Majesty should lose no time in writing to appoint
Sir Robert Peel to be here to-morrow, for though he was not
afraid of Sir Robert taking affront, his Party would be too
ready to construe any delay on the Queen's part into a slight.
He said the Prince had been with him just before, and amongst
other things had urged him to continue to him and to the
Queen his advice and assistance, especially on measures affecting
their private concerns and family concerns; he told Lord
Melbourne it was on these points that he felt Lord Melbourne's
advice had been peculiarly sound, and there was no reason
why this should not be continued, and any communication
might be made through me. Lord Melbourne said that the
Prince had also entered upon the subject of the Baroness, and
expressed the constant state of annoyance he was kept in by
her interference. Lord Melbourne said to me: "It will be far
more difficult to remove her after the change of Government
than now, because if pressed to do it by a Tory Minister, the
Queen's prejudice would be immediately aroused." I admitted
this, but said that though the Prince felt that if he pressed
the point against the Baroness remaining, he should be able to
carry it, still his good feeling and affection for the Queen prevented
him from pressing what he knew would be painful, and
what could not be carried without an exciting scene; he must
remain on his guard, and patiently abide the result. People
were beginning much better to understand that lady's character,
and time must surely work its own ends.</p>

<p class="ind2">On my being sent for by the Prince, Lord Melbourne said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.304" id="pagei.304"></a>[page&nbsp;304]</span>
"I shall see you again before I take my leave." I was much
affected by the earnestness with which this was said, and said
I would certainly be with him before he saw the Queen tomorrow.</p>
<span class="rightnote">PARTING WITH LORD MELBOURNE</span>
<p class="ind2">The Prince said that Her Majesty was cheerful and in good
spirits, and the only part of the approaching scene which he
dreaded was the farewell with Lord Melbourne. The Queen
had, however, been much relieved by the Prince arranging for
her hearing from Lord Melbourne whenever she wished it.</p>




<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and thanks your Majesty much for the very clever and interesting
etchings which your Majesty most kindly sent him yesterday
evening. Lord Melbourne will ever treasure them as
remembrances of your Majesty's kindness and regard, which
he prizes beyond measure.</p>

<p class="ind">They will, as your Majesty says, certainly recall to recollection
a melancholy day, but still Lord Melbourne hopes and
trusts that with the divine blessing it will hereafter be looked
back upon with less grief and bitterness of feeling, than it must
be regarded at present.</p>



<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Memorandum by Mr Anson.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">THE PRINCE'S POSITION</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>30th August 1841</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">Directly I got here this morning the Prince sent for me, and
said he had been made somewhat uneasy by a conversation
he had just had with the Queen. Her Majesty said that after
the manner in which the Tories had treated the Prince (relative
to annuity) he ought now to keep them at a distance. She said
they would try to flatter him, and would all come to see him;
this he should resist, and should refuse to see them, at all events
for some time.</p>

<p class="ind2">The Prince wished me to mention this to Lord Melbourne
when I went to take leave of him, and to urge Lord Melbourne
to set this right with the Queen by his advice before he parted
with the Queen, reminding him that his view had always been
that from this moment the Prince would take up a new position,
and that the Queen, no longer having Lord Melbourne to resort
to in case of need, must from this moment consult and advise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.305" id="pagei.305"></a>[page&nbsp;305]</span>
with the Prince. That Lord Melbourne should urge the
Queen to have no scruple in employing the Prince, and showing
that unless a proper understanding existed from the first, he in
attempting to do good would be easily misrepresented.</p>

<p class="ind2">I found Lord Melbourne alone in his dressing-room and put
this case before him. He said he had always thought that
when he left the service of the Queen the Prince would of necessity
be brought forward, and must render great assistance to
the Queen; and the Queen's confidence in his judgment having
so much increased, this consequence was the more natural.
The Prince must, however, be very cautious at first, and in
a little time he would fall into it. He must be very careful
not to alarm the Queen, by Her Majesty for an instant supposing
that the Prince was carrying on business with Peel
without her cognisance.</p>

<p class="ind2">If it were possible for any one to advise Peel, he would
recommend that he should write fully to Her Majesty, and
<i>elementarily</i>, as Her Majesty always liked to have full knowledge
upon everything which was going on. He would advise
the Queen to be cautious in giving a verbal decision, that she
should not allow herself to be <i>driven into a corner</i>, and forced
to decide where she felt her mind was not made up and required
reflection.</p>

<p class="ind2">Peel should be very careful that intelligence came first from
him direct. King William was very particular upon this point,
so was the Queen.</p>

<p class="ind2">I asked Lord Melbourne if he had considered the future
position of himself with the Queen, and also of Peel with the
Queen. He said he owned he had not and would avoid entering
into any discussion&mdash;he felt sure that he should be regarded
with extreme jealousy, not so much by Peel as by the party.
He would be looked upon as Lord Bute had been in his relation
to George III.,&mdash;always suspected of secret intercourse and
intrigue. He would make me the medium of any written communication.</p>

<p class="ind2">With regard to Peel's position with the Queen, he thought
that circumstances must make it. He thought the Queen must
see him oftener than King William did him, as he thought the
present state of things would require more frequent intercourse.
The late King used to see him once a week after the
Lev&eacute;e, seldom oftener; all the rest of the business was transacted
by correspondence, but this mode, though it had its
merits in some respect, very much impeded the public business.</p>

<p class="ind2">The less personal objections the Queen took to any one the
better, as any such expression is sure to come out and a personal
enemy is made. It was also to be recollected that Peel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.306" id="pagei.306"></a>[page&nbsp;306]</span>
was in a very different position now, backed by a large majority,
to when the other overture was made. He had the power <i>now</i>
to extort what he pleased, and he fancied he saw the blank
faces of the heads of the Party when Peel told them that he
had agreed to the dismissal or resignation of only three of the
Queen's ladies.</p>

<p class="ind2">Lord Melbourne said the Queen was afraid she never could
be at ease with Peel, because his manner was so embarrassed,
and that conveyed embarrassment also to her, which it would
be very difficult to get over.</p>

<p class="ind2">The Queen took leave of Lord Melbourne to-day. Her
Majesty was much affected, but soon recovered her calmness.</p>

<p class="ind2">Peel had his first audience at half-past three o'clock.</p>

<span class="rightnote">MELBOURNE'S OPINION OF THE PRINCE</span>

<p class="indright"><i>30th August 1841</i> (6 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>).</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
The announcement has been made in both Houses of Parliament.
A few words were said by Lord Stanley<sup>73</sup> in the House
of Commons, and nothing in the House of Lords.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne cannot satisfy himself without again stating
to your Majesty in writing what he had the honour of saying
to your Majesty respecting his Royal Highness the Prince.
Lord Melbourne has formed the highest opinion of His Royal
Highness's judgment, temper, and discretion, and he cannot
but feel a great consolation and security in the reflection that
he leaves your Majesty in a situation in which your Majesty
has the inestimable advantage of such advice and assistance.
Lord Melbourne feels certain that your Majesty cannot do better
than have recourse to it, whenever it is needed, and rely upon
it with confidence.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne will be anxious to hear from your Majesty
as to what has passed with Sir R. Peel. Your Majesty will,
Lord Melbourne is sure, feel that the same general secrecy
which your Majesty has always observed respecting public
affairs is more particularly necessary at the present moment.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne earnestly hopes that your Majesty is well
and composed, and with the most anxious wishes for your
Majesty's welfare and happiness, remains ever your Majesty's
most devoted and attached Servant, and he trusts that he
may add, without presumption, your Majesty's faithful and
affectionate Friend.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE HOUSEHOLD</span>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty might say, if to your Majesty it seems good,
that in consequence of the Addresses voted by both Houses of
Parliament, your Majesty's servants had tendered their resignations,
and that for the same reason your Majesty had
accepted those resignations. That your Majesty's present
servants possessed your Majesty's confidence, and that you
only parted with them in deference to the opinion of Parliament.</p>

<p class="ind">That your Majesty naturally had recourse to Sir Robert
Peel as possessing the confidence of the great Party which
constitutes the majority of both Houses, and that you were
prepared to empower him to form an Administration.</p>

<p class="ind">That your Majesty did not conceive that the giving him this
commission of itself empowered him to advise the removal
of the officers of your Majesty's Household; that you conceive
that all that the Constitution required was that the
Sovereign's Household should support the Sovereign's Ministers;
but that you were prepared to place at his disposal,
and to take his advice upon all the offices of the Household
at present filled by members of either House of Parliament,
with the exception of those whom your Majesty might think
proper to name, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., Lord Byron<sup>74</sup>&mdash;and it should be understood
that this exception was not to extend further than to
him.</p>

<p class="ind">If Sir Robert Peel should wish that in case of Lord
Byron's remaining it should be considered as a fresh appointment
made by his advice, this wish might properly be
acceded to.</p>

<p class="ind"><i>The Ladies</i>.&mdash;If any difficulty should arise it may be asked
to be stated in writing, and reserved for consideration. But it
is of great importance that Sir Robert Peel should return to
London with full power to form an Administration. Such
must be the final result, and the more readily and graciously
it is acquiesced in the better.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty must take care not to be driven to the wall,
and to be put into a situation in which it is necessary to Aye
or No. No positive objection should be taken either to men
or measures.</p>

<p class="ind">It must be recollected that at the time of the negotiation in
1839 Lord Melbourne and Lord John Russell were still at the
head of a majority in the House of Commons. This is not the
case now.</p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 75: The Peel Ministry of 1841 was unique in containing three ex-Premiers: Sir Robert
Peel himself, the Earl of Ripon, and the Duke of Wellington, who succeeded Lord Goderich
as Premier in 1828. Ripon's career was a curious one; he was a singularly ineffective
Prime Minister, and indeed did not, during the course of his Ministry (August 1827-January
1828), ever have to meet Parliament. He was disappointed at not being invited
to join the Wellington Ministry, subsequently joined the Reform Ministry of Lord Grey,
but followed Lord Stanley, Sir James Graham, and the Duke of Richmond out of it. In
August 1841 he moved the vote of want of confidence in the Melbourne Ministry, and
became President of the Board of Trade in Peel's Government. In 1846 it fell to him,
when President of the Board of Control, to move the Corn Law Repeal Bill in the Lords.</p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: -0.5em;">The only later instance of an ex-Premier accepting a subordinate office was in the case
of Lord John Russell, who, in 1852, took the Foreign Office under Aberdeen, subsequently
vacating the office and sitting in the Cabinet without office. In June 1854, he became
Lord President of the Council, and left the Ministry when it was menaced by Roebuck's
motion. When Lord Palmerston formed a Ministry in 1855, Lord John, after an interval,
became Colonial Secretary, again resigning in five months. Finally, in 1859, he went
back to the Foreign Office, where he remained until he succeeded Palmerston as Premier
in 1865.</p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: -0.5em;">The Government also contained three future Premiers, Aberdeen, Stanley, and Gladstone.</p>

<span class="rightnote">INTERVIEW WITH PEEL</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span> <i>30th August 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">... The first interview with Sir Robert Peel has gone off
well, and only lasted twenty minutes; and he sends the
Queen to-morrow, in writing, the proposed arrangements, and
will only come down on Wednesday morning. He first wished
to come to-morrow, but on the Queen's saying that he need not
to do that, but might send it and only come down Wednesday,
he thought the Queen might prefer having it to consider a
little, which she said she certainly should, though she meant
no want of confidence. The Queen, in the first instance,
stated that she concluded he was prepared for her sending for
him, and then stated exactly what Lord Melbourne wrote, viz.,
the resignation having taken place in consequence of the
Addresses&mdash;the Queen's great regret at parting with her
present Ministers&mdash;the confidence she had in them, and her
only acceding in consequence of the Addresses in Parliament,
and then that consequently she looked to him (Sir Robert
Peel) as possessing the confidence of both Houses of Parliament
to form an Administration. He made many protestations
of his sorrow, at what must give pain to the Queen (as
she said to him it did), but of course said he accepted the task.
The Duke of Wellington's health too uncertain, and himself
too prone to sleep coming over him&mdash;as Peel expressed it&mdash;to
admit of his taking an office in which he would have much to
do, but to be in the Cabinet, which the Queen expressed her
wish he should. He named Lord De Grey<sup>76</sup> as Lord Lieutenant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.310" id="pagei.310"></a>[page&nbsp;310]</span>
of Ireland, and Lord Eliot<sup>77</sup> as Secretary for Ireland, who, he
said, were both moderate people. The Queen said she gave<span class="rightnote">HOUSEHOLD APPOINTMENTS</span>
up to him the officers of State and those of her Household who
were in Parliament, and he then asked if Lord Liverpool would
be agreeable as Lord Steward (the Queen said he would), and
if she would object to Lord Jersey as Master of the Horse (she
said she would not), as she believed he understood it perfectly.
He said he was so anxious to do everything which could be
agreeable to the Queen, that he wished her to name whom she
should like as Lord Chamberlain; she said he might suggest
some one, but as he would not, and pressed the Queen to name
whoever she pleased, she said she should like the Duke of
Rutland, and he said he would certainly name it to him. The
Queen said that Lord Melbourne had always been very particular
to name no one who might be disagreeable to her in the
Household, and Sir R. Peel said he felt this, and should be
most anxious to do what could be agreeable to me and for my
comfort, and that he would even sacrifice any advantage to
this. The Queen mentioned the three Ladies' resignation, and
her wish not to fill up the three Ladies' places immediately.
She mentioned Lady Byron,<sup>78</sup> to which he agreed immediately,
and then said, as I had alluded to those communications, he
hoped that he had been understood respecting the <i>other</i> appointments
(meaning the Ladies), that provided I chose some
who had a leaning towards the politics of the Administration,
I might take any I liked, and that he quite understood
that I should notify it to them. The Queen said this was her
rule, and that she wished to choose moderate people who
should not have scruples to resign in case another Administration
should come in, as changing was disagreeable to her.
Here it ended, and so far well. He was very anxious the
Queen should understand <i>how</i> anxious he was to do everything
which was agreeable to the Queen. The Queen wishes to
know if Lord Melbourne thinks she should name the Duchess
of Buccleuch Mistress of the Robes, on Wednesday, and if she
shall ask Sir Robert to sound the Duchess, or some one else,
and then write to appoint her? She thinks of proposing
Lady de la Warr and Lady Abercorn by and by as the two
Ladies, but these she will sound herself through other people,
or Lady Canning, or Lady Rosslyn, in case these others should
not take it. She should say she meant to sound those, and no
more. What the Queen felt when she parted from her dear,<span class="rightnote">THE QUEEN'S DISTRESS</span>
kind friend, Lord Melbourne, is better imagined than described;
she was dreadfully affected for some time after, but is calm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.311" id="pagei.311"></a>[page&nbsp;311]</span>
now. It is very, very sad; and she cannot quite believe it yet.
The Prince felt it very, very much too, and really the Queen
cannot say how kind and affectionate he is to her, and how
anxious to do everything to lighten this heavy trial; he was
quite affected at this sad parting. We do, and shall, miss you
so dreadfully; Lord Melbourne will easily understand what a
change it is, after these four years when she had the happiness
of having Lord Melbourne always about her. But it will not
be so long till we meet again. Happier and brighter times
will come again. We anxiously hope Lord Melbourne is well,
and got up well and safe. The Queen trusts he will take care
of his valuable health, now more than ever.</p>

The Queen had said to Sir Robert that though she did not
conceive the Minister could demand any of the Household
appointments, still it was Her Majesty's intention to give up
to him the great offices of State, and all other places in the
Household filled by people in Parliament. He was to send
his proposed list for offices the next day and be at Windsor
the morning after that. Lord Melbourne had written to the
Queen the night before, stating his opinion of the Prince&mdash;that
he had great discretion, temper, and judgment, and that he
considered him to be well worthy of Her Majesty's confidence,
and that now was the time for Her Majesty to feel comfort and
assistance from giving him her fullest confidence. He had
just received the Queen's answer to this, saying what "pleasure
it had given the Queen to receive his letter with this expression
of his opinion of her beloved husband, and that what
he said could not fail to increase the confidence which she
already felt in him. He was indeed a great comfort to her in
this trying moment; at times she was very low indeed though
she strove to bear up. It would always be a satisfaction to
her to feel secure of Lord Melbourne's faithful and affectionate
friendship to her and the Prince. She hoped after a time to
see him here again, and it would always be a pleasure to her to
hear from him frequently."</p>

<p class="ind2">From South Street I went to Sir Robert Peel's. I told him
I came to speak to him about Lord Exeter, whom the Prince
proposed to make the head of his Household, should it not
interfere with any of Sir Robert's arrangements for the Queen.
Sir Robert said he was so good a man and one that he felt sure
the Prince would like, and he therefore thought he had better
propose the situation to him at once.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne had the pleasure of receiving last night both
your Majesty's letters, the one dated four o'clock, and written
immediately after your Majesty's interview with Sir R. Peel,
the other dated half-past nine. Lord Melbourne thanks your
Majesty much for them both, and for the expressions of kindness
contained in them. Lord Melbourne will ever consider
the time during which your Majesty is good enough to think
that he has been of service to your Majesty the proudest as
well as the happiest part of his life.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne has read with great care your Majesty's
very clear and full account of what passed. It appears to
Lord Melbourne that nothing could be better. Sir Robert
Peel seems to have been anxious to act with the utmost respect
and consideration for your Majesty, and your Majesty most
properly and wisely met him half-way. In the spirit in which
the negotiation has been commenced I see the prospect of a
termination of it, which will be not so unsatisfactory to your
Majesty as your Majesty anticipated, and not, Lord Melbourne
trusts, disadvantageous to the country....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne concludes with the most anxious wishes for
your Majesty's happiness and with expressing a great admiration
of the firmness, prudence, and good sense with which your
Majesty has conducted yourself.</p>

with her Ministers, which he said it was quite natural she should
feel, and quite right she should express. This I know from

Palmerston for your Majesty's gracious expressions towards
them. Viscount Palmerston sees with deep regret the termination
of those duties in your Majesty's service, in the course of

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">South Street</span>, <i>2nd September 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He received your Majesty's letter yesterday evening, and was
very glad to learn from it that your Majesty was not ill satisfied
with Sir Robert Peel, and that the arrangements were going on
smoothly, which it is highly desirable that they should. Your
Majesty should desire Sir Robert Peel to give notice to all
those who have insignia of office, such as Seals, Wands, to give
up, to attend at Claremont on Friday; but of course he will
do this of himself. Your Majesty will have much to go through
upon that day and much that is painful. Your Majesty should
spare yourself and be spared as much as possible. It will not
be necessary for Lord Melbourne to go down. He may be considered
as having resigned at the Audience which he had of your
Majesty at Windsor, and Lord Melbourne has ventured to tell
Lord Lansdowne that he thinks he need not do so either, and
that your Majesty will excuse his attendance. Lord Melbourne
need say nothing about the Secretaries of State, with all of
whom your Majesty is so well acquainted; but perhaps your
Majesty will not omit to thank Mr Baring<sup>83</sup> cordially for his
services. He is a thoroughly honest man and an able public
servant. If your Majesty could say to the Lord Chancellor,<sup>84</sup>
"that you part with him with much sorrow; that you are
sensible that much of the strength of the late Administration
was derived from the manner in which he discharged the duties
of his office, and that you consider his retirement a great and
serious loss to the country," it would certainly be no more than
he deserves.</p>

<p class="ind">It is thought by some who know him here that the Duke of
Rutland will be so extremely pleased with the offer being made,
and that by your Majesty yourself, that he will accept it; but
he is a year older than Lord Melbourne, and therefore hardly
fit for any very active duty....</p>

<p class="ind">The appointment of Colonel Arbuthnot will of course be very
agreeable to the Duke of Wellington. The Arbuthnots are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.315" id="pagei.315"></a>[page&nbsp;315]</span>
quiet, demure people before others; but they are not without
depth of purpose, and they are very bitter at bottom.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty will not forget the two Knights for Mr de la
Beche<sup>85</sup> and Major Monro.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne begins to hope that this affair will be got
through more satisfactorily and with less annoyance than your
Majesty anticipated. As long as your Majesty is desirous of
receiving his communications, he will be always most careful
to give your Majesty his impartial opinion and the best advice
which he has to offer. His most fervent prayer will always be
for your Majesty's welfare and happiness.</p>

<p class="ind">....Lord Melbourne hopes and trusts that when to-morrow
is over your Majesty will recover from that depression of spirits
under which your Majesty now labours. Lord Melbourne
never doubted that it would be so, but is glad to learn from
your Majesty the support and consolation which your Majesty
finds in the advice and affection of the Prince.</p>

<p class="ind">This is the last letter which Lord Melbourne will send in a
box. He will to-morrow morning return his keys to the
Foreign Office, and after that your Majesty will be good
enough to send the letters, with which you may honour Lord

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">South Street</span>, <i>3rd September 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne earnestly hopes that your Majesty is well
after this trying day.<sup>86</sup> Lord Melbourne has thought and felt
for your Majesty all this morning. But now that the matter
is settled it will be necessary that your Majesty should take a
calm and composed view of the whole situation, which Lord
Melbourne trusts that your Majesty will find by no means
unsatisfactory.</p>

<p class="ind">And first with respect to public affairs. In the concerns of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.316" id="pagei.316"></a>[page&nbsp;316]</span>
a great nation like this there will always be some difficulties
and entanglements, but upon the whole the present state is
good and the prospect is good for the future. There is no
reason to expect that Sir Robert Peel will either be desirous or
be able to take a very different course from that which has
been taken by your Majesty's late servants, and some difficulties
will certainly be removed, and some obstacles smoothed,
by the change which has lately taken place.</p>

<p class="ind">With respect to the effect which will be produced upon the
comfort of your Majesty's private life, it would be idle in Lord
Melbourne, after what your Majesty has said, to doubt of the
manner in which your Majesty will feel the change, which must
take place in your Majesty, to long accustomed habits and
relations. But your Majesty may rest assured of Lord Melbourne's
devoted and disinterested attachment to your
Majesty, and that he will devote himself to giving to your
Majesty such information and advice as may be serviceable to
your Majesty with the sole view of promoting your Majesty's
public interests and private happiness.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne hopes, and indeed ventures to expect, that
your Majesty, upon reflection and consideration of the real
state of circumstances, will recover your spirits, and Lord
Melbourne has himself great satisfaction in thinking upon the
consideration of the advice which he has given, that it has not
tended to impair your Majesty's influence and authority, but,
on the contrary, to secure to your Majesty the affection, attachment,
approbation, and support of all parties.</p>

<p class="ind">In the course of this correspondence Lord Melbourne has
thought it his duty to your Majesty to express himself with
great freedom upon the characters of many individuals, whose
names have come under consideration, but Lord Melbourne
thinks it right to say that he may have spoken upon insufficient
grounds, that he may have been mistaken, and that the persons
in question may turn out to be far better than he has been
induced to represent them.</p>

and which are so well calculated to gain a fair and powerful
influence over the minds and feelings of others. Your Majesty
may depend upon it, that the impression made upon the minds
of all who were present yesterday, is most favourable. Of
course, with persons in new and rather awkward situations,
some of whom had never been in high office before, all of whom
had not been so now for some years, there was a good deal of
embarrassment and mistakes. Forms which are only gone
through at long intervals of time, and not every day, are necessarily
forgotten, and when they are required nobody knows
them. But Lord Melbourne cannot really think that they
looked cross; most probably they did look shy and embarrassed.

Melbourne mentioned the matter yesterday to his sister, and
he encloses the letter which she has written to him this morning,
after reflecting upon the subject. By that letter your Majesty
will perceive that Jocelyn is not so much in debt, as Lord
Melbourne's letter had led your Majesty to suppose....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord B&mdash;&mdash; is a very old friend of Lord Melbourne's.
They were at Eton together, and intimate there. He is a
gentlemanly man and a good man, but not very agreeable.

Lord Melbourne is glad, for old acquaintance' sake, that your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.318" id="pagei.318"></a>[page&nbsp;318]</span>
Majesty has taken him. Lord Melbourne must again repeat
that when he writes with so much freedom about individual
characters, it is only to put your Majesty in possession of what
he knows respecting them, and not with a view of inducing
your Majesty to object to their being appointed....</p>

<p class="ind">Might not Fanny have the Bedchamber Woman's place?
It would be a help to her, and would not take her away from
home. This only strikes Lord Melbourne as he is writing.</p>

about Fanny will not do.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne encloses Lady Palmerston's two notes upon
the subject, which will explain to your Majesty what she wishes.
But if Jocelyn is himself to get a place, this will be a better
arrangement, and puts an end to all the others.</p>

naming to the Queen any appointment he wishes to make in
his department, and always to take her pleasure upon an appointment
before he settles on them; this is a point upon
which the Queen has always laid great stress. This applies in
great measure to the appointment of Physicians and Chaplains,
which used to be very badly managed formerly, and who were
appointed in a very careless manner; but since the Queen's
accession the Physicians and Chaplains have been appointed
only for merit and abilities, by the Queen herself, which the
Queen is certain Sir Robert Peel will at once see is a far better
way, and one which must be of use in every way. Sir Robert
Peel may also tell Lord De la Warr that it is unnecessary for
him to appear in uniform, as the Queen always dispenses with
this in the country. This applies also to the Ministers, who
the Queen does not expect or wish should appear in uniform
at Councils which are held in the country. The Queen concludes
that it will be necessary to hold a Council some time
next week to swear in some of the new Officers who are not
Privy Councillors; but Sir Robert Peel will be able to tell the
Queen when he thinks this will be necessary.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Uncle,</span>&mdash;I begin my letter to-day, for fear I
should have no time to write to-morrow. Your kind letter
gave me great pleasure, and I must own your silence on all that
was going on distressed me very much! It has been indeed a
sad time for me, and I am still bewildered, and can't believe
that my excellent Lord Melbourne is no longer my Minister, but
he will be, as you say, and has <i>already</i> proved himself, <i>very</i>
useful
and <i>valuable</i> as my friend out of office. He writes to me
often, and I write to him, and he gives really the fairest and
most impartial advice possible. But after seeing him for four
years, with very few exceptions&mdash;<i>daily</i>&mdash;you may imagine that
I <i>must</i> feel the change; and the longer the time gets since we
parted, the <i>more</i> I feel it. <i>Eleven days</i> was the <i>longest</i> I
ever
was without seeing him, and this time will be elapsed on Saturday,
so you may imagine what the change must be. I cannot
say what a comfort and support my beloved Angel is to me, and
how well and how kindly and properly he behaves. I cannot
resist copying for you what Lord Melbourne wrote to me
about Albert, the evening after we parted; he has already
praised him greatly to me, before he took leave of me. It is as
follows:</p>

<p class="ind">"Lord Melbourne cannot satisfy himself without again
stating to your Majesty in writing what he had the honour of
saying to your Majesty respecting H.R.H. the Prince. Lord
Melbourne has formed the highest opinion of H.R.H.'s judgment,
temper, and discretion, and he cannot but feel a great
consolation and security in the reflection that he leaves your
Majesty in a situation in which your Majesty has the inestimable
advantage of such advice and assistance. Lord Melbourne
feels certain that your Majesty cannot do better than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.321" id="pagei.321"></a>[page&nbsp;321]</span>
have recourse to it, whenever it is needed, and rely upon it
with confidence."</p>

<p class="ind">This naturally gave me great pleasure, and made me very
proud, as it comes from a person who is no flatterer, and
would not have said it if he did not think so, or feel so. The
new Cabinet you have by this time seen in the papers.</p>

<p class="ind">The Household (of which I send you a list) is well constituted&mdash;<i>for
Tories</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen has written to me to say Bourqueney has
announced Ste Aulaire<sup>90</sup> as Ambassador. This is very well,
but let me beg you, for decency's sake, to stop his coming
immediately; if <i>even not meant</i> to, it would have the effect of
their sending an ambassador the moment the Government
changed, which would be too marked, and most <i>offensive personally</i>
to <i>me</i>. Indeed Guizot behaved very badly about refusing
to sign the Slave Trade Treaty<sup>91</sup> which they had so long
ago settled to do; it is unwise and foolish to irritate the late
Government who may so easily come in again; for Palmerston
will <i>not</i> forgive nor <i>forget</i> offences, and then France would be
worse off than before, with England. I therefore <i>beg</i> you to
stop Ste Aulaire for a little while, else <i>I</i> shall feel it a great
personal offence.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Niece,</span>&mdash;I have not ventured to disturb you
with a letter since we parted, knowing how fully your time was
employed with business of importance. I cannot any longer
now refrain to enquire after you, after all you have gone
through lately, and I must congratulate you with all my heart
on having so well completed your difficult task.</p>

<p class="ind">There is but one voice of praise, I hear, of your perfect composure
and beautiful conduct during the trying scenes of last
week. It has gratified me more than I can express, for I had
fully expected it of you, and it has made me very happy to find
that it has been generally remarked and has given so much
satisfaction. Everybody feels deeply for you, and the devotion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.322" id="pagei.322"></a>[page&nbsp;322]</span>
and zeal in your service is redoubled by the interest your
trying position has evoked. May our Heavenly Father support
and guide you always as hitherto, is my constant prayer!</p>

<p class="ind">I hope that the selection of your Government is to your own
satisfaction, and though the change must have been trying to
you, I trust that you will have perfect confidence in the able
men who form your Council. Our beloved late King's anxious
wishes to see Wellington and Peel again at the head of the
Administration is now fulfilled. His blessing rests upon you.</p>

<p class="ind">Excuse my having touched upon this subject, but I could
not keep silent whilst the heart is so full of earnest good wishes
for your and the country's prosperity.</p>

<p class="ind">I hope that an article of the newspapers, of the indisposition
of your darling child, is not true, and that she is quite well.
God bless and protect her!...</p>

<p class="ind">I am much amused with reading your Life by Miss Strickland,<sup>92</sup>
which, though full of errors, is earnest on the whole, and
very interesting to <i>me</i>. However, I wish she would correct the
gross errors which otherwise will go down to posterity. She
ought to have taken first better information before she published
her work....</p>

<p class="indright"><i>9th September 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen takes this opportunity of writing to Sir Robert
Peel <i>confidentially</i> about another person: this is about Lord
&mdash;&mdash;. The Queen is strongly of opinion that Lord &mdash;&mdash; should
<i>not</i> be employed in any post of importance, as his being so
would, in her opinion, be detrimental to the interests of the
country. The Queen wishes Sir Robert to state this to Lord
Aberdeen as her opinion. The Queen is certain that Sir
Robert will take care that it should not be known generally
that this is her opinion, for she is always most anxious to avoid
anything that might appear personal towards anybody. The
Queen cannot refrain from saying that she cannot quite approve
of Sir Charles Bagot's appointment,<sup>93</sup> as from what she
has heard of his qualities she does not think that they are of a
character quite to suit in the arduous and difficult position in
which he will be placed. At the same time the Queen does not
mean to object to his appointment (for she has already formally
approved of it), but she feels it her duty to state frankly
and at all times her opinion, as she begs Sir Robert also to do
unreservedly to her. For the future, it appears to the Queen
that it would be best in all appointments of such importance
that before a direct communication was entered into with the
individual intended to be proposed, that the Queen should be
informed of it, so that she might talk to her Ministers fully
about it; not because it is likely that she would object to
the appointment, but merely that she might have time to be
acquainted with the qualities and abilities of the person. The
Queen has stated this thus freely to Sir Robert as she feels
certain that he will understand and appreciate the motives
which prompt her to do so. The Queen would wish the
Council to be at two on Tuesday, and she begs Sir Robert would
inform her which of the Ministers besides him will attend.</p>

<span class="rightnote">DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENTS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">South Street</span>, <i>10th September 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">... Lord Melbourne has no doubt that Sir Robert Peel has
the most anxious wish to do everything that can be agreeable
to your Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty should not omit to speak fully and seriously to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.325" id="pagei.325"></a>[page&nbsp;325]</span>
him upon the disposal of great appointments. Their Diplomatic
Corps, from which Ambassadors and Governors are
generally taken, is the weakest part of their establishment.
They have amongst them men of moderate abilities and of
doubtful integrity, who yet have held high offices and have
strong claims upon them. The public service may suffer most
essentially by the employment of such men. Lord Melbourne
would say to Peel that "affairs depend more upon the hands
to which they are entrusted than upon any other cause, and
that you hope he will well consider those whose appointment
to high and important situations he sanctions, and that he will
not suffer claims of connection or of support to overbalance a
due regard for your Majesty's service and the welfare of the
country." Such an expression of your Majesty's opinion may
possibly be a support to Sir Robert Peel against pretensions
which he would be otherwise unable to resist; but this is
entirely submitted to your Majesty's judgment, seeing that
your Majesty, from an exact knowledge of all that is passing,
must be able to form a much more correct opinion of the propriety
and discretion of any step than Lord Melbourne can
do....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne has a letter from Lord John Russell, rather
eager for active opposition; but Lord Melbourne will write to
your Majesty more fully upon these subjects from Woburn.</p>



<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">CANADA</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Woburn Abbey</span>, <i>12th September 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne has this morning received your Majesty's
letter of yesterday. Lord Melbourne entirely agrees with your
Majesty about appointments. He knows, as your Majesty
does from experience, that with all the claims which there are
to satisfy, with all the prejudices which are to be encountered,
and with all the interests which require to be reconciled, it is
impossible to select the best men, or even always those properly
qualified. He is the last man who would wish that a
Minister who has the whole machine of the Government before
him should be necessarily thwarted or interfered with in the
selection of those whom he may be desirous to employ. Lord
Melbourne would therefore by no means advise your Majesty
to throw difficulty in the way of the diplomatic arrangements
which may be proposed, unless there should be in them anything
manifestly and glaringly bad. The nomination of
Lord &mdash;&mdash; would have been so, but otherwise it cannot very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.326" id="pagei.326"></a>[page&nbsp;326]</span>
greatly signify who is the Ambassador at Vienna, or even at
Petersburg or Paris. Stuart de Rothesay<sup>94</sup> and Strangford<sup>95</sup>
are not good men, either of them, but it will be difficult for
Lord Aberdeen to neglect their claims altogether. Heytesbury<sup>96</sup>
is an able man, the best they have. Sir Robert Gordon<sup>97</sup>
is an honest man, slow but not illiberal. It would be well if
your Majesty showed Lord Aberdeen that you know these men,
and have an opinion upon the subject of them.</p>

<p class="ind">Canada is another matter. It is a most difficult and most
hazardous task. There has been recent rebellion in the
country. A new Constitution has lately been imposed upon it
by Parliament. The two Provinces have been united, and the
united Province is bordered by a most hostile and uncontrollable
community, the United States of North America. To
govern such a country at such a moment requires a man of great
abilities, a man experienced and practical in the management
of popular assemblies.... It is possible that matters may go
smoothly there, and that if difficulties do arise Sir C. Bagot
may prove more equal to them than from his general knowledge
of his character Lord Melbourne would judge him to
be....</p>

<p class="ind">Upon the subject of diplomatic appointments Lord Melbourne
has forgotten to make one general observation which he
thinks of importance. Upon a change of Government a very
great and sudden change of all or many of the Ministers at
Foreign Courts is an evil and to be avoided, inasmuch as it
induces an idea of a general change of policy, and disturbs
everything that has been settled. George III. always set his
face against and discouraged such numerous removals as
tending to shake confidence abroad in the Government of
England generally and to give it a character of uncertainty
and instability. It would be well if your Majesty could make
this remark to Lord Aberdeen.</p>

<span class="rightnote">LORD ELLENBOROUGH'S REPORT</span>

<span class="rightnote" style="margin-top:3em;">INDIA AND AFGHANISTAN</span>

<p class="ind">Lord Ellenborough presents his most humble duty to your
Majesty, and humbly acquaints your Majesty that having, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.327" id="pagei.327"></a>[page&nbsp;327]</span>
the morning after the Council held at Claremont on the third
of this month, requested the clerks of the India Board to put
him in possession of the latest information with respect to the
Political, Military, and Financial affairs of India, he ascertained
that on the 4th of June instructions had been addressed
to the Governor-General of India in Council in the following
terms:&mdash;"We direct that unless circumstances now unknown
to us should induce you to adopt a different course, an adequate
force be advanced upon Herat, and that that city and its
dependencies may be occupied by our troops, and dispositions
made for annexing them to the kingdom of Cabul."<sup>99</sup></p>

<p class="ind">The last letters from Calcutta, dated the 9th of July, did not
intimate any intention on the part of the Governor-General in
Council of directing any hostile movement against Herat, and
the Governor-General himself having always evinced much
reluctance to extend the operations of the army to that city,
it seemed almost probable that the execution of the orders of
the 4th of June would have been suspended until further communication
could be had with the Home Authorities.</p>

<p class="ind">Nevertheless, in a matter of so much moment it did not
appear to be prudent to leave anything to probability, and at
Lord Ellenborough's instance your Majesty's confidential
servants came to the conclusion that no time should be lost
in addressing to the Governor-General in Council a letter in
the following terms&mdash;such letter being sent, as your Majesty
must be aware, not directly by the Commissioners for the
Affairs of India, but, as the Act of Parliament prescribes in
affairs requiring secrecy, by their direction through and in
the name of the Secret Committee of the Court of Directors:&mdash;</p>


<p class="ind" style="margin-top: 3em;">"From the Secret Committee of the Court of Directors of
the East India Company to the Governor-General of India in
Council.</p>

<p class="ind">"Her Majesty having been pleased to form a new Administration,
we think it expedient that no step should be taken
with respect to Herat which would have the effect of compelling
the prosecution of a specific line of Policy in the countries
beyond the Indus, until the new Ministers shall have had time
to take the subject into their deliberate consideration, and to
communicate to us their opinions thereupon.</p>

<p class="ind">"We therefore direct that, unless you should have already
taken measures in pursuance of our Instructions of the 4th
of June 1841&mdash;which commit the honour of your Government
to the prosecution of the line of Policy which we thereby
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.328" id="pagei.328"></a>[page&nbsp;328]</span>
ordered you to adopt, or which could not be arrested without
prejudice to the Public interests, or danger to the troops
employed&mdash;you will consider those Instructions to be suspended.</p>

<p class="ind">"We shall not fail to communicate to you at an early
period our fixed decision upon this subject."</p>


<p class="ind" style="margin-top: 3em;">It was not possible to bring this subject before your Majesty's
confidential servants before the afternoon of Saturday the 4th.
The mail for India, which should have been despatched on the
1st, had been detained till Monday the 6th by the direction of
your Majesty's late Ministers, in order to enable your Majesty's
present servants to transmit to India and China any orders
which it might seem to them to be expedient to issue forthwith.
Further delay would have been productive of much mercantile
inconvenience, and in India probably of much alarm. In this
emergency your Majesty's Ministers thought that your Majesty
would be graciously pleased to approve of their exercising at
once the power of directing the immediate transmission to
India of these Instructions.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty must have had frequently before you strong
proofs of the deep interest taken by Russia in the affairs of
Herat, and your Majesty cannot but be sensible of the difficulty
of maintaining in Europe that good understanding with Russia
which has such an important bearing upon the general peace,
if serious differences should exist between your Majesty and
that Power with respect to the States of Central Asia.</p>

<p class="ind">But even if the annexation of Herat to the kingdom of Cabul
were not to have the effect of endangering the continuance of
the good understanding between your Majesty and Russia,
still your Majesty will not have failed to observe that the
further advance of your Majesty's forces 360 miles into the
interior of Central Asia for the purpose of effecting that annexation,
could not but render more difficult of accomplishment
the original intention of your Majesty, publicly announced
to the world, of withdrawing your Majesty's troops
from Afghanistan as soon as Shah Sooja should be firmly
established upon the throne he owes to your Majesty's aid.</p>

<p class="ind">These considerations alone would have led Lord Ellenborough
to desire that the execution of the orders given on the
4th of June should at least be delayed until your Majesty's
confidential servants had had time to consider maturely the
Policy which it might be their duty to advise your Majesty to
sanction with respect to the countries on the right bank of the
Indus; but financial considerations strengthened this desire,
and seemed to render it an imperative duty to endeavour to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.329" id="pagei.329"></a>[page&nbsp;329]</span>
obtain time for mature reflection before any step should be
taken which might seriously affect the tranquillity of Europe,
and must necessarily have disastrous effects upon the Administration
of India.</p>
<span class="rightnote">INDIAN FINANCES</span>
<p class="ind">It appeared that the political and military charges now
incurred beyond the Indus amounted to &pound;1,250,000 a year&mdash;that
the estimate of the expense of the additions made to the
Army in India, since April 1838, was &pound;1,138,750 a year, and
that the deficit of Indian Revenue in 1839-40 having been
&pound;2,425,625, a further deficit of &pound;1,987,000 was expected in
1840-41.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty must be too well informed of the many evils
consequent upon financial embarrassment, and entertains too
deep a natural affection for all your Majesty's subjects, not
to desire that in whatever advice your Majesty's confidential
servants may tender to your Majesty with respect to the
Policy to be observed in Afghanistan, they should have especial
regard to the effect which the protracted continuance of
military operations in that country, still more any extension of
them to a new and distant field, would have upon the Finances
of India, and thereby upon the welfare of eighty millions of
people who there acknowledge your Majesty's rule.</p>

<p class="ind">In the conversation that the Queen had with Lord Aberdeen
last week, she omitted mentioning two persons to him. The
one is Lord Heytesbury; the Queen believes him to be a very
able man, and would it not therefore be a good thing to employ
him in some important mission? The other person is Mr
Aston, who is at Madrid; the Queen hopes it may be possible
to leave him there, for she thinks that he acted with great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.330" id="pagei.330"></a>[page&nbsp;330]</span>
discretion, prudence, and moderation since he has been there,
and the post is one of considerable importance. He was, the

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen presents his most humble duty to your
Majesty....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen has seen the favourable opinion which your
Majesty has been graciously pleased to express of Lord Heytesbury,
and he humbly presumes to think that this honour is
not unmerited. The situation of Governor-General of India
has recently been proposed by Sir Robert Peel for Lord Heytesbury's
acceptance, which has been declined by him, and it is
understood that Lord Heytesbury is not at present desirous
of public employment.<sup>100</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty's servants have not yet fully considered the
propriety of submitting to your Majesty any proposal of a
change in the Spanish Mission; but the opinion which your
Majesty has been pleased to signify respecting the conduct
of Mr Aston at Madrid appears, in the humble judgment of
Lord Aberdeen, to be fully confirmed by the correspondence
in this Office.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen would, however, venture humbly to mention
that the person filling this Mission has usually been replaced
on a change of the Administration at home. Should this be
the case in the present instance, Lord Aberdeen begs to assure
your Majesty that the greatest care will be taken to select an
individual for your Majesty's approbation who may be qualified
to carry into effect the wise, just, and moderate policy which
your Majesty has been graciously pleased to recognise in the

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Royal Lodge</span>, <i>21st September 1841</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">Saw Baron Stockmar this morning at the Castle, and had a
good deal of conversation with him on various matters. He is
very apprehensive that evil will spring out of the correspondence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.331" id="pagei.331"></a>[page&nbsp;331]</span>
now carried on between the Queen and Lord Melbourne.
He thinks it is productive of the greatest possible danger, and
especially to Lord Melbourne; he thought no Government
could stand such undermining influence. I might tell this to
Lord Melbourne, and say that if he was totally disconnected
from his Party, instead of being the acknowledged head, there
would not be the same objection. He said, Remind Lord
Melbourne of the time immediately after the Queen's accession,
when he had promised the King of the Belgians to write to him
from time to time an account of all that was going on in this
country; and upon Lord Melbourne telling him of this promise,
he replied, This will not do. It cannot be kept a secret
that you keep up this correspondence, and jealousy and distrust
will be the fruit of a knowledge of it. "Leave it to me,"
he said, "to arrange with the King; you cease to write, and I
will put it straight with the King."</p>

<p class="ind2">The Baron seemed to expect Lord Melbourne to draw the
inference from this that a correspondence between Lord
Melbourne and the Queen was fraught with the same danger,
and would, when known, be followed by distrust and jealousy
on the part of Sir Robert Peel. I said I reconciled it to myself
because I felt that it had been productive of much good and
no harm&mdash;and that, feeling that it was conducted on such
honourable terms, I should not, if it were necessary, scruple to
acquaint Sir Robert Peel of its existence. The Baron said,
"Ask Lord Melbourne whether he would object to it." He
said Peel, when he heard it, would not, on the first impression,
at all approve of it; but prudence and caution would be
immediately summoned to his aid, and he would see that it
was his policy to play the generous part&mdash;and would say he
felt all was honourably intended, and he had no objection to
offer&mdash;"but," said the Baron, "look to the result. Distrust,
being implanted from the first, whenever the first misunderstanding
arose, or things took a wrong turn, all would, in
Peel's mind, be immediately attributed to this cause."</p>

deny that I <i>feel</i> the <i>change</i>, and I own I am much happier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.332" id="pagei.332"></a>[page&nbsp;332]</span>
when I need <i>not</i> see the Ministers; luckily they do not want
to see me often. I feel much the King's kindness about Ste
Aulaire;<sup>101</sup> I shall see him here on Tuesday next.</p>

<p class="ind">I return you our excellent friend Melbourne's letter, which
I had already seen, as he sent it me to read, and then seal
and send. I miss him much, but I often hear from him,
which is a great pleasure to me. It is a great satisfaction to
us to have Stockmar here; he is a great resource, and is now
in excellent spirits.</p>

<p class="ind">Mamma is, I suppose, with you now, and we may expect
her here either next Thursday or Friday. How much she
will have to tell us! I am very grateful for what you say of
Claremont, which could so easily be made perfect; and I
must say we enjoy ourselves there always <i>particuli&egrave;rement</i>....
Albert begs me to make you his excuses for not writing,
but I can bear testimony that he really has not time to-day.
And now <i>addio!</i> dearest Uncle, and pray believe me, always,
your devoted Niece,</p>

<span class="rightnote">FINE ARTS COMMISSION</span>

<p class="indright"><i>26th September 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and begs to be permitted to submit for your Majesty's consideration
a suggestion which has occurred to Sir Robert Peel,
and which has reference to the communication which he
recently addressed to your Majesty on the subject of the
promotion of the Fine Arts in connection with the building of
the new Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel would humbly enquire from your Majesty
whether (in the event of your Majesty's being graciously pleased
to approve of the appointment of a Royal Commission for the
further investigation and consideration of a subject of such
deep importance and interest to the encouragement of art in
this country) your Majesty would deem it desirable that the
Prince should be invited in the name of your Majesty to place
himself at the head of this Commission, and to give to it the
authority and influence of his high name, and the advantage
of his taste and knowledge.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel will not of course mention this subject to
any one, until he has had the honour of receiving from your
Majesty an intimation of your Majesty's opinions and wishes
on this subject.</p>

<span class="rightnote">DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENTS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">South Street</span>, <i>28th September 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">... The diplomatic appointments are as well as they could
be made. At least Lord Melbourne thinks so&mdash;at least as
much in consequence of those whom they exclude, as of those
whom they admit. The Duke of Beaufort will do better for
Petersburg than for Vienna. He is hardly equal to the place,
which requires a clever man, it being more difficult to get
information there, and to find out what is going on, than in
any other country in Europe.... But Lord Melbourne does
not much regard this, and the Duke of Beaufort possesses one
advantage, which is of the greatest importance in that country.
He is a soldier, was the Duke of Wellington's Aide-de-Camp,
and served during much of the Peninsular War. He will
therefore be able to accompany the Emperor to reviews, and
to talk with him about troops and man&oelig;uvres. Sir Robert
Gordon and Sir S. Canning will do very well.<sup>102</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is very glad to hear that your Majesty
was pleased and impressed with Archdeacon Wilberforce's<sup>103</sup>
sermon and his manner of delivering it. Lord Melbourne has
never seen nor heard him. His father had as beautiful and
touching a voice as ever was heard. It was very fine in itself.
He spoiled it a little by giving it a methodistical and precatory
intonation.</p>

<p class="ind">Hayter has been to Lord Melbourne to-day to press him to
sit to him, which he will do as soon as he has done with Chantrey.
Chantrey says that all Lord Melbourne's face is very
easy except the mouth. The mouth, he says, is always the
most difficult feature, and he can rarely satisfy himself with
the delineation of any mouth, but Lord Melbourne's is so
flexible and changeable that it is almost impossible to catch it.</p>

<span class="rightnote">MELBOURNE'S ADVICE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">South Street</span>, <i>1st October 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He received your Majesty's letter yesterday evening, and
cannot express to your Majesty how much obliged he feels by
your Majesty's taking the trouble to give him so much information
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.334" id="pagei.334"></a>[page&nbsp;334]</span>
upon so many points. Ste Aulaire's hair-powder
seems to make a very deep and general impression.<sup>104</sup> Everybody
talks about it. "He appears to be very amiable and
agreeable," everybody says, but then adds, "I never saw
a man wear so much powder." A head so whitened with
flour is quite a novelty and a prodigy in these times. Lord
Melbourne has not yet seen him, but means to call upon him
immediately. Lord Melbourne is upon the whole glad that
the Duke of Beaufort has declined St Petersburg. It is an
appointment that might have been acquiesced in, but would
not have been approved. Bulwer<sup>105</sup> will not be a bad choice
to accompany Sir Charles<sup>106</sup> to Canada. Your Majesty knows
Bulwer well. He is clever, keen, active; somewhat bitter
and caustic, and rather suspicious. A man of a more straight-forward
character would have done better, but it would be
easy to have found many who would have done worse. Lord
Melbourne is very glad that it has been offered to the Prince
to be at the head of this Commission, and that His Royal
Highness has accepted it. It is an easy, unexceptionable
manner of seeing and becoming acquainted with a great many
people, and of observing the mode of transacting business in
this country. The Commission itself will be a scene of very
considerable difference of opinion. Lord Melbourne is for
decorating the interior of the Houses of Parliament, if it be
right to do so, but he is not for doing it, whether right or
wrong, for the purpose of spending the public money in the
encouragement of the Fine Arts. Whether it is to be painting
or sculpture, or both; if painting, what sort of painting, what
are to be the subjects chosen, and who are to be the artists
employed? All these questions furnish ample food for discussion,
difference, and dispute. Chantrey says fresco will
never do; it stands ill in every climate, will never stand long
in this, even in the interior of a building, and in a public work
such as this is, durability is the first object to be aimed at.
He says that there is in the Vatican a compartment of which
the middle portion has been painted by Giulio Romano<sup>107</sup> in
fresco, and at each of the ends there is a figure painted by
Raphael in oil. The fresco painting has been so often repaired
in consequence of decay, that not a vestige of the original
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.335" id="pagei.335"></a>[page&nbsp;335]</span>
work remains; while the two figures painted by Raphael in
oil still stand out in all their original freshness, and even
improved from what they were when first executed....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne dined and slept on Wednesday at Wimbledon.<sup>108</sup>
He met there Lord and Lady Cottenham, Lord<sup>109</sup> and
Lady Langdale, Lord Glenelg and his brother, Mr Wm. Grant,
who was his private secretary, and is an amusing man. Lord
Melbourne is going there again to-morrow to stay until Monday.
The place is beautiful; it is not like Claremont, but it is quite
of the same character, and always puts Lord Melbourne in mind
of it. The Duchess has many merits, but amongst them is the
not small one of having one of the best cooks in England.</p>

<span class="rightnote">PEERS AND AUDIENCES</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Whitehall</span>, <i>2nd October 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir James Graham with humble duty begs to lay before your
Majesty two letters, which he has received from the Earl of
Radnor,<sup>110</sup> together with the copy of the answer which Sir James
Graham returned to the first of the two letters.</p>

<p class="ind">If the presentation of Petitions were the sole subject of the
Audience, it might be needless to impose on your Majesty the
trouble incident to this mode of receiving them, since they
might be transmitted through the accustomed channel of one
of the Secretaries of State; but Sir James Graham infers from
a conversation which, since the receipt of the letters he has had
with Lord Radnor, that the Audience is asked in exercise of a
right claimed by Peers of the Realm.</p>

<p class="ind">The existence of this right is not recognised by Statute; but
it rests in ancient usage, and is noticed by Judge Blackstone in
his Commentaries on the Laws of England in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ind">"It is usually looked upon to be the right of each particular
Peer of the Realm to demand an Audience of the King, and to
lay before him, with decency and respect, such matters as he
shall judge of importance to the public weal."</p>

<p class="ind">The general practice on the part of the Sovereign has been
not to refuse these Audiences when Peers have asked them....</p>

Subject and Servant,</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>3rd October 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Sir James Graham's communication
with the enclosures. She thinks that it would be extremely
inconvenient if Audiences were to be granted to Peers for the
purpose of presenting Petitions or Addresses. The Queen knows
that it has always been considered a sort of right of theirs to
ask for and receive an Audience of the King or Queen. But
the Queen knows that upon several occasions Lord Melbourne
and Lord John Russell wrote to the Peers who requested
Audiences, stating that it would be very inconvenient for the
Queen, particularly in the country, and that they had better
either put off asking for it, till the Queen came to town, or send
what they had to say; communicate in writing&mdash;which was
complied with. If, therefore, Sir James Graham would state
this to Lord Radnor, he may probably give up pressing for an
Audience. Should he, however, urge his wish very strongly,
the Queen will see him in the manner proposed by Sir James.
The Queen would wish to hear from Sir James again before
she gives a final answer.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE CHINESE CAMPAIGN</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">India Board</span>, <i>2nd October 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Ellenborough, with his most humble duty to your
Majesty, humbly acquaints your Majesty that your Majesty's
Ministers, taking into consideration the smallness of the force
with which the campaign in China was commenced this year,
and the advanced period of the season at which the reinforcements
would arrive (which reinforcements would not so raise
the strength of the Army as to afford any reasonable expectation
that its operations will produce during the present year
any decisive results), have deemed it expedient that instructions
would be at once issued to the Indian Government with
a view to the making of timely preparations for the campaign
of 1842.<sup>111</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty's Ministers are of opinion that the War with
China should be conducted on an enlarged scale, and the
Indian Government will be directed to have all their disposable
military and naval force at Singapore in April, so that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.337" id="pagei.337"></a>[page&nbsp;337]</span>
operations may commence at the earliest period which the
season allows.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Ellenborough cannot but entertain a sanguine expectation
that that force so commencing its operations, and directed
upon a point where it will intercept the principal internal
communication of the Chinese Empire, will finally compel the
Chinese Government to accede to terms of Peace honourable
to your Majesty, and affording future security to the trade of
your Majesty's subjects.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He had the honour of receiving your Majesty's letter of the
2nd inst. yesterday, at Wimbledon. If Lord Melbourne should
hear of anything of what your Majesty asks respecting the
impression made upon Sir Robert and Lady Peel, he will take
care and inform your Majesty, but, of course, they will speak
very favourably, and if they feel otherwise will not breathe it

<span class="rightnote">SIR FRANCIS CHANTREY</span>
<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne sat to Sir F. Chantrey on Saturday last.
He will, Lord Melbourne believes, require only one more sitting,
which he wishes to be at the distance of a week from the last,
in order that he may take a fresh view of the bust, and not
become reconciled to its imperfections by continually looking
at it. It may give the Prince some idea of the national feeling
which prevails here, when he is told that Lord Melbourne upon
asking Sir F. Chantrey what ought to be done if foreign artists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.338" id="pagei.338"></a>[page&nbsp;338]</span>
were employed to paint the Houses of Parliament, received
from him the following answer: "Why, their heads ought to
be broke and they driven out of the country, and, old as I am,
I should like to lend a hand for that purpose."</p>


<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">South Street</span>, <i>5th October 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">... Lord Melbourne, by telling your Majesty what Sir
Francis Chantrey said respecting foreign artists, and by requesting
your Majesty to repeat it to the Prince, by no means
intended to imply that there was any disposition on the part
of His Royal Highness to recommend the employment of
foreigners. He only meant to convey the idea of the strength
of the prejudice which is felt by enlightened and able men upon
the subject. Lord Melbourne has been sitting this morning
to Hayter for the picture of the marriage, and he (Hayter) held
an entirely contrary language. His tone is: "If foreign artists
are more capable than English, let them be employed. All I
require is that the work should be done as well as it can be."
The English are certainly very jealous of foreigners, and so,
Lord Melbourne apprehends, are the rest of mankind, but not
knowing himself any nation except the English, he cannot venture
to make positively that assertion. Lord Melbourne has
been reading the evidence given before the committee of the
House of Commons upon this subject. It is well worth attention,
particularly Mr Eastlake's,<sup>112</sup> which appears to Lord
Melbourne to be very enlightened, dispassionate, and just....</p>

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Memorandum by Mr Anson.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">THE PRINCE'S GRANT</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>6th October 1841</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">Sat by Her Majesty last night at dinner.</p>

<p class="ind2">The Queen had written to Lord Melbourne about coming to
the Castle, but in his answer he had made no allusion to it;
she did not know whether this was accidental or intentional,
for he very often gave no answer to questions which were put.</p>

<p class="ind2">I told Her Majesty that I feared he had raised an obstacle to
his visit by making a strong speech against the Government
just at the time he was thinking of coming. That this attack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.339" id="pagei.339"></a>[page&nbsp;339]</span>
had identified him as the leader of his Party, at a moment when
I had been most anxious that he should abstain from taking an
active part, and by withdrawing himself from politics he would
enable himself to become the more useful friend to Her Majesty.
The Queen had not seen the speech, was sorry he had felt himself
obliged to make it, but it would be difficult for him to avoid
it after having been so long Prime Minister.</p>

<p class="ind2">Her Majesty told me that previous to the exit of the late
Government, Lord John had earnestly cautioned Her Majesty
not to propose any new grant of money, as it would in the case
of &pound;70,000 for the new stables, however unfairly, bring great
unpopularity upon the Queen. I said in regard to any increase
to the Prince's annuity, I thought it would be very imprudent
in him to think of it, except under very peculiar circumstances
which might arise, but which could not yet be foreseen. The
Queen said that <i>nothing</i> should induce Her Majesty to accept
such a favour from these Ministers. Peel probably now regretted
his opposition to the grant, but it was, and was intended
to be, a personal insult to herself, and it was followed up [by]
opposition to her private wishes in the precedency question,
where the Duke of Wellington took the lead against her wishes,
as Peel had done in the Commons against the Prince's grant.
She never could forget it, and no favour to her should come
from such a quarter. I told Her Majesty I could not rest the
Prince's case on Her Majesty's objections if they were the only
ones which could be brought forward. If the case again rose
I feared Her Majesty would find many who before, from Party
views, voted according to Her Majesty's wishes, would now
rank on the opposite side.</p>

<p class="ind2">Her Majesty asked Dr Hawtrey the evening before who
was the cleverest boy at Eton.</p>

<p class="ind2">Dr Hawtrey made a profound bow to the Queen and said,
"I trust your Majesty will excuse my answering, for if I did
I make 600 enemies at once."</p>




<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Memorandum by Baron Stockmar.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><i>6th October 1841</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">The Queen had asked Lord Melbourne whether he would
soon visit her at Windsor. He had not replied on that point,
but had written to Prince Albert in order to learn first the
Prince's opinion on the feasibility of the matter.</p>

<p class="ind2">The Prince sent for me and consulted with me. I was of
opinion that the Prince had better refrain from giving an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.340" id="pagei.340"></a>[page&nbsp;340]</span>
answer, and that I should give my opinion in the written form
of a Memorandum, with which Anson should betake himself to
town. He was to read it aloud to Melbourne, and orally to
add what amplifications might be necessary.</p>

<p class="ind2">And so it was done.</p>


<span class="rightnote">RELATIONS WITH PEEL</span>

<p class="ind2">My Memorandum was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ind2">
Sir Robert Peel has yet to make his position opposite<sup>113</sup> the
Queen, which for him to obtain is important and desirable for
obvious reasons. I have good cause to doubt that Sir Robert
is sure within himself of the good-will and confidence of the
Queen. As long as the secret communication exists between
Her Majesty and Lord Melbourne, this ground, upon which
alone Sir Robert could obtain the position necessary to him as
Premier, must remain cut away from under his feet. I hold,
therefore, this secret interchange an <i>essential injustice</i> to Sir
Robert's present situation. I think it equally wrong to call
upon the Prince to give an opinion on the subject, as he has
not the means to cause his opinion to be either regarded or
complied with. In this particular matter nobody has paramount
power to do right or wrong but the Queen, and more
especially Lord Melbourne himself. To any danger which may
come out of this to Her Majesty's character, the caution and
objection must come from him, and from him alone; and if I was
standing in his shoes I would show the Queen, of my own
accord, and upon constitutional grounds <i>too</i>, that a continued
correspondence of that sort must be fraught with imminent
danger to the Queen, especially to Lord Melbourne, and
to the State.

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 113: <i>I</i>.<i>e</i>. with.</p>

<p class="ind2" style="margin-top: 3em;">I then gave Anson the further arguments with which he
was to accompany the reading out of this Memo.</p>

<span class="rightnote">DISCRETION URGED ON MELBOURNE</span>

<p class="ind2">On the next day Anson went to Melbourne and told him
that his note to him had raised a great consultation, that the
Prince felt much averse to giving any opinion in a case upon
which he could exercise no control, and in which, if it was
known that he had given his sanction, he would be held
responsible for any mischief which might arise. He had consulted
Baron Stockmar, who had written the enclosed opinion,
which the Prince had desired Anson to read to Lord Melbourne.
Melbourne read it attentively twice through, with an occasional
change of countenance and compression of lips. He said on
concluding it: "This is a most decided opinion indeed, quite
an '<i>apple<sup>114</sup> opinion</i>.'" Anson told him that the Prince felt that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.341" id="pagei.341"></a>[page&nbsp;341]</span>
if the Queen's confidence in Peel was in a way to be established,
it would be extremely shaken by his (Lord Melbourne's) visit at
such a moment. He felt that it would be better that Lord
Melbourne's appearance should be in London, where he would
meet the Queen only on the terms of general society, but at the
same time he (the Prince) was extremely reluctant to give an
opinion upon a case which Lord Melbourne's own sense of right
ought to decide. Anson added how he feared his speech of
yesterday in the House of Lords<sup>115</sup> had added another impediment
to his coming at this moment, as it had identified him
with and established as the head of the Opposition party, which
he (Anson) had hoped Melbourne would have been able to
avoid. Melbourne, who was then sitting on the sofa, rushed
up upon this, and went up and down the room in a violent
frenzy, exclaiming&mdash;"God eternally d&mdash;n it!" etc., etc.
"Flesh and blood cannot stand this. I only spoke upon the
defensive, which Ripon's speech at the beginning of the
session rendered quite necessary. I cannot be expected to
give up my position in the country, neither do I think that
it is to the Queen's interest that I should."</p>
<span class="rightnote">MELBOURNE'S INFLUENCE</span>
<p class="ind2">Anson continued that the Baron thought that no Ministry
could stand the force of such an undercurrent influence, that
all the good that was to be derived from pacifying the Queen's
mind at the change had been gained, and that the danger which
we were liable to, and which threatened him in particular, could
only be averted by his own straightforward decision with the
Queen. Anson asked him if <i>he</i> saw any danger likely to arise
from this correspondence. After a long pause he said, "<i>I
certainly cannot think it right</i>," though he felt sure that some
medium of communication of this sort was no new precedent.
He took care never to say anything which could bring his
opinion in opposition <i>to Sir Robert's, and he should distinctly
advise the Queen to adhere to her Ministers in everything,<sup>116</sup> unless
he saw the time had arrived at which it might be resisted</i>.<sup>117</sup> The
principal evil, replied Anson, to be dreaded from the continuance
of Lord Melbourne's influence was, according to the
Baron's opinion, that so long as the Queen felt she could resort
to Lord Melbourne for his advice, she never would be disposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.342" id="pagei.342"></a>[page&nbsp;342]</span>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dear Baron</span>,&mdash;Peel sent for me this morning to speak
to me about the contents of his letter to me. After some
general conversation on matters respecting the Royal Household,
he said that he had had much satisfaction in his intercourse
lately with Her Majesty, and specifically yesterday, and
he asked me whether I had seen Her Majesty or the Prince
yesterday, and whether they were satisfied with him. I told
him that except in public I had not seen Her Majesty, and
except for a moment in your room I had not seen the Prince;
but that as he spoke to me on this matter, I must take the
opportunity of saying a word to him about <i>you</i>, from whom
I had learnt yesterday that both the Queen and Prince are
extremely well pleased with him. That I had known you very
long, but that our great intimacy began when King Leopold
sent you over just previous to the Queen's accession; that we
had acted together on that occasion, and that our mutual
esteem and intimacy had increased; that your position was a
very peculiar one, and that you might be truly said to be a
species of second parent to the Queen and the Prince; that
your only object was their welfare, and your only ambition
to be of service to them; that in this sense you had communicated
with Melbourne, and that I wished that in this sense
you should communicate with him (Peel). He said that he
saw the matter exactly as I did, that he wished to communicate
with you, and felt the greatest anxiety to do everything to
meet the wishes of the Queen and Prince in all matters within
his power, and as far as consistent with his known and avowed
political principles; that in all matters respecting the Household
and their private feelings that the smallest hint sufficed
to guide him, as he would not give way to any party feeling or
job which should in any way militate against Her Majesty or His
Royal Highness's comfort; that he wished particularly that
it should be known that he never had a thought of riding
<i>roughshod</i> over Her Majesty's wishes; that if you would come
to him at any time, and be candid and explicit with him, you
might depend upon his frankness and discretion; that above
all, if you had said anything to him, and expressed a wish that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.343" id="pagei.343"></a>[page&nbsp;343]</span>
it might not be communicated even to the Duke of Wellington,
(that was his expression), that he wished me to assure you that
your wishes should be strictly attended to. Pray give me a
line to say that you do not disapprove of what I have done.
We had a great deal more conversation, but with this I will
not now load my letter, being ever sincerely yours,</p>

<span class="rightnote">AUDIENCES OF PEERS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">South Street</span>, <i>8th October 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He has this morning received your Majesty's letter of yesterday.
There can be no doubt that your Majesty is right about the
Audiences which have been requested....</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel is probably right in supposing that the claim
of a Peer to an Audience of the Sovereign originated in early
times, and before the present course of government by responsible
advisers was fully and decidedly established, which
it hardly can be said to have been until after the accession of
the House of Hanover, but the custom of asking for such
Audiences, and of their being in general granted, was well
known, and has for the most part been observed and adhered
to. Lord Melbourne remembers that during the part of the
French War, when considerable alarm began to prevail respecting
its duration, and the serious aspect which it was assuming,
George III. gave Audiences to the Duke of Norfolk and others
which he certainly would not have been inclined to do if he
had not thought himself bound by his duty and by Constitutional
precedent. At the time of the passing of the Roman
Catholic Relief Act, George IV. received very many Peers,
much no doubt against his will, who came to remonstrate with
him upon the course which his Ministers were pursuing.
William IV. did the same at the time of the Reform Bill, and
certainly spoke upon the subject in a manner which Lord
Melbourne always thought indiscreet and imprudent. Upon
the whole, the practice has been so much acted upon and
established, that Lord Melbourne will certainly not think it
wise to make any alteration now, especially as it has in itself
beneficial effects, especially as in a time of strong political
feeling it is a satisfaction to the people to think that their
wishes and opinions are laid before the Sovereign fairly and
impartially. It is not likely to be a very heavy burthen, inasmuch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.344" id="pagei.344"></a>[page&nbsp;344]</span>
as such Audiences are only asked at particular moments,
and they are not in themselves very burthensome nor difficult
to deal with. It is only for the Sovereign to say that he is
convinced of the good motives which have actuated the step,
and that consideration will be given to the matter and arguments
which have been stated.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne has one vague recollection of a correspondence
upon this subject between Lord Holland and some
King, but does not remember the circumstances with any
accuracy.</p>

<p class="ind">Duncannon<sup>119</sup> persuaded Brougham to give up asking an
Audience upon condition of Lord Melbourne's promising to
place his letters in your Majesty's hands, which he did.<sup>120</sup> Lord
Charlemont<sup>121</sup> also was prevented in some manner or another,
which Lord Melbourne forgets.</p>

<p class="ind">Upon the whole, Lord Melbourne thinks that it is best to
concede this privilege of the Peerage, whether it actually exists
or not, but to restrain it within due and reasonable bounds,
which in ordinary times it is not difficult to do. Extraordinary
times must be dealt with as they can be....</p>

<p class="ind">Lady A&mdash;&mdash; is, as your Majesty says, good-natured. She
talks three or four times as much as she ought, and like many
such women often says exactly the things she ought not to say.
Lady B&mdash;&mdash; has ten times the sense of her mother, and a little
residue of her folly.</p>

<span class="rightnote">GOVERNOR-GENERALSHIP OF INDIA</span>

<p class="indright"><i>9th October 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel, with his humble duty to your Majesty,
begs leave to inform your Majesty that in consequence of the
opinion which your Majesty was graciously pleased to express
when Sir Robert Peel last had the honour of waiting upon your
Majesty, with respect to the superior qualifications of Lord
Ellenborough for the important trust of Governor-General
of India, Sir Robert Peel saw his Lordship yesterday, and
enquired whether he would permit Sir Robert Peel to propose
his appointment to your Majesty.</p>
<span class="rightnote">LORD ELLENBOROUGH</span>
<p class="ind">Lord Ellenborough was very much gratified by the proposal,
admitted at once that it was very difficult to find an unexceptionable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.345" id="pagei.345"></a>[page&nbsp;345]</span>
candidate for an office of such pre-eminent importance,
but made some difficulty on two points.</p>

<p class="ind">First&mdash;Considerations of health, which though disregarded
personally, might, he feared, interfere with the execution of
such unremitting and laborious duties as would devolve upon
the Governor-General of India.</p>

<p class="ind">Secondly&mdash;The consideration that on his acceptance of the
office he would be required by law to give up during his tenure
of it no less than &pound;7,500 per annum, the amount of compensation
now paid to him in consequence of the abolition of a very
valuable office<sup>122</sup> which he held in the Courts of Law.</p>

<p class="ind">During Lord Ellenborough's conversation with Sir Robert
Peel, and while the mind of Lord Ellenborough was very much
in doubt as to the policy of his acceptance of the office, the
box which contained your Majesty's note of yesterday was
brought to Sir Robert Peel.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel humbly acquaints your Majesty that he
ventured to read to Lord Ellenborough on the instant the
concluding paragraph of your Majesty's note, namely&mdash;</p>

<p class="ind">"The more the Queen thinks of it, the more she thinks that
Lord Ellenborough would be far the most fit person to send to
India."</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel is perfectly convinced that this opinion of
your Majesty, so graciously expressed, removed every doubt
and difficulty from Lord Ellenborough's mind, and decided
him to forgo every personal consideration rather than appear
unmindful of such a favourable impression of his qualifications
for public service on the part of his Sovereign.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel humbly hopes that your Majesty will not
disapprove of the use which he made of a confidential note from
your Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">As your Majesty kindly permitted Sir Robert Peel to send
occasionally letters to your Majesty of a private rather than
a public character, he ventures to enclose one from the Duke
of Wellington on the subject of the appointment of Governor-General.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel had observed to the Duke of Wellington that
he had great confidence in Lord Ellenborough's integrity, unremitting
industry, and intimate knowledge of Indian affairs;
that his only fear was that Lord Ellenborough might err from
<i>over-activity</i> and eagerness&mdash;but that he hoped his tendency
to hasty decisions would be checked by the experience and
mature judgment of Indian advisers on the spot.</p>

<p class="ind">The Duke of Wellington's comments have reference to these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.346" id="pagei.346"></a>[page&nbsp;346]</span>
observations of Sir Robert Peel. Your Majesty will nevertheless
perceive that the Duke considers, upon the whole, "that
Lord Ellenborough is better qualified than any man in England
for the office of Governor-General."</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Uncle</span>,&mdash;&ndash; ... Respecting the Spanish affairs,<sup>123</sup>
I can give you perfectly satisfactory intelligence concerning the
Infants' return. Espartero sees them return with the greatest
regret, but said he felt he could not prevent them from doing
so. If, however, they should be found to intrigue at all, they
will not be allowed to remain. Respecting a marriage with the
eldest son of Dona Carlotta, I know <i>positively</i> that Espartero
<i>never</i> would <i>hear</i> of it; but, on the other hand, he is equally
strongly opposed to poor little Isabel marrying any French
Prince, and I must add that <i>we</i> could <i>never allow that</i>. You
will see that I have given you a frank and fair account....</p>


<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 123: The Queen-mother, who was living in Paris, had been deprived by a vote of the Cortes
of the guardianship of the young Queen, Isabella II., and risings in her interest now took
place at Pampeluna and Vittoria. On the 7th October, a bold attempt was made at
Madrid to storm the Palace and get possession of the person of the young Queen. Queen
Christina denied complicity, but the Regent, Espartero, suspended her pension on the
ground that she had encouraged the conspirators.</p>


<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">South Street</span>, <i>12th October 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and returns many thanks for the letter received yesterday
informing Lord Melbourne of the time of your Majesty's coming
to London. Lord Melbourne earnestly hopes that your
Majesty continues well.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is very glad to hear of the appointment of
Lord Ellenborough. The reasons which your Majesty gives
are sound and just, and it is of great importance that a man
not only of great ability but of high station, and perfectly in
the confidence of the Government at home, should be named to
this important post. Lord Ellenborough is a man of great
abilities, of much knowledge of India, of great industry and of
very accurate habits of business, and Lord Melbourne knows
of no objection to his appointment, except the loss of him here,
where, whether in or out of office, he has always been of great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.347" id="pagei.347"></a>[page&nbsp;347]</span>
service. He has hitherto been an unpopular man and his
manners have been considered contemptuous and overbearing,
but he is evidently much softened and amended in this respect,
as most men are by time, experience, and observation. Lord
Fitzgerald<sup>124</sup> is a very able public man, Lord Melbourne would
say one of the most able, if not the most able they have; but
Lord Melbourne is told by others, who know Lord Fitzgerald
better, that Lord Melbourne overrates him. He is a very
good speaker, he has not naturally much industry, and his
health is bad, which will probably disable him from a very
close and assiduous attention to business. It is, however,
upon the whole an adequate appointment, and he is perhaps
more likely to go on smoothly with the Court of Directors,
which is a great matter, than Lord Ellenborough.</p>


<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 124: On Lord Ellenborough becoming Governor-General, Lord Fitzgerald and Vesci, an

<span class="rightnote">FRANCE AND SPAIN</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Foreign Office</span>, <i>16th October 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen, with his most humble duty, begs to lay
before your Majesty a private letter from M. Guizot, which has
just been communicated to him by M. de Ste-Aulaire, on the
recent attempt in favour of Queen Christina in Spain. Your
Majesty will see that although M. Guizot denies, with every
appearance of sincerity, all participation of the French Government
in this attempt, he does not conceal that it has their
cordial good wishes for its success. These feelings, on the part
of such a Government as that of France, will probably be
connected with practical assistance of some kind, although
M. Guizot's declarations may perhaps be literally true.</p>




<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Queen Victoria to the Earl of Aberdeen.</i></h5>

<p class="ind">The Queen must say that she fears the French are at the
bottom of it, for their jealousy of our influence in Spain is such,
that the Queen fears they would not be indisposed to see civil
war to a certain degree restored rather than that Spain should
go on quietly supported by us.<sup>125</sup> The Queen, however, hopes
that, as far as it is possible, the English Government will support
the present Regent, who is thoroughly attached to England,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.348" id="pagei.348"></a>[page&nbsp;348]</span>
and who, from all that the Queen hears of him, is the
fittest man they have in Spain for the post he occupies; and
indeed matters till now had gone on much more quietly than
they had for some time previous, since Espartero is at the head
of the Government. The French intrigues should really be
frustrated. The Queen certainly thinks that M. Guizot's
veracity is generally not to be doubted, but the conduct of
France regarding Spain has always been very equivocal.</p>

<span class="rightnote">MASTERSHIP OF TRINITY</span>

<p class="indright"><i>16th October 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel, with his humble duty to your Majesty, begs
leave to acquaint your Majesty that the Master of Trinity
College, Cambridge, has formally signified his wish to retire
from the duties of that important trust.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel has reason to believe that it would be
advantageous that the selection of a successor to Dr. Wordsworth
should be made from members of Trinity College who
are or have been fellows of the College. Of these, the most
eminent in respect to the qualifications required in the office
of Master, and to academical distinction, are:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="candidates" align="center" style="margin-top: 3em;">
    <tr><td class="main">Professor Whewell.<sup>126</sup></td></tr>
    <tr><td class="main">The Rev. Mr Martin,<sup>127</sup> Bursar of the College.</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="main">The Rev. Dr Wordsworth,<sup>128</sup> Head Master of Harrow School,
        and son of the present Master of Trinity.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="ind" style="margin-top: 3em;">The latter is a highly distinguished scholar, but his success as
Head Master of Harrow has not been such as to overcome the
objection which applies on general grounds to the succession
of a father by a son in an office of this description.</p>

<p class="ind">Professor Whewell is a member of Trinity College of the
highest scientific attainments. His name is probably familiar
to your Majesty as the author of one of the Bridgewater
Treatises,<sup>129</sup> and of other works which have attracted considerable
notice.</p>

<p class="ind">He is a general favourite among all who have had intercourse
with him from his good temper and easy and conciliatory
manners. Though not <i>peculiarly</i> eminent as a divine (less so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.349" id="pagei.349"></a>[page&nbsp;349]</span>
at least than a writer on scientific and philosophical subjects),
his works manifest a deep sense of the importance of religion
and sound religious views. The Archbishop of Canterbury<sup>130</sup>
and the Bishop of London<sup>131</sup> (himself of Trinity College) incline
to think that the most satisfactory appointment upon the whole
would be that of Professor Whewell.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel, after making every enquiry into the subject,
and with a deep conviction of the importance of the appointment,
has arrived at the same conclusion, and humbly therefore
recommends to your Majesty that Professor Whewell
should succeed Dr Wordsworth as Master of Trinity College,
Cambridge.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen received Lord Aberdeen's letter yesterday evening,
and quite approves of the draft to Mr Aston, and of Lord
Aberdeen's having sent it off at once. Her earnest wish is that
the English Government should be firm, and uphold the Regent
as far as it is in our power. The Queen has perused M. Guizot's
letter with great attention, but she cannot help fearing that
assistance and encouragement has been given in some shape or
other to the revolts which have taken place. The Queen
Christina's residence at Paris is very suspicious, and much to be
regretted; every one who saw the Queen and knew her when
Regent, knew her to be clever and <i>capable</i> of governing, had
she but attended to her duties. This she did not, but wasted
her time in frivolous amusements and neglected her children
sadly, and finally left them. It was her <i>own</i> doing, and therefore
it is not the kindest conduct towards her children, but the
very <i>worst</i>, to try and disturb the tranquillity of a country
which was just beginning to recover from the baneful effects of
one of the most bloody civil wars imaginable.</p>
<span class="rightnote">THE SPANISH MARRIAGE</span>
<p class="ind">The Queen is certain that Lord Aberdeen will feel with her
of what importance it is to England that Spain should not
become subject to French interests, as it is evident <i>France
wishes</i> to make it. The marriage of Queen Isabel is a most
important question, and the Queen is likewise certain that Lord
Aberdeen sees at once that we could never let her marry a
French Prince. Ere long the Queen must speak to Lord
Aberdeen on this subject. In the meantime the Queen thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.350" id="pagei.350"></a>[page&nbsp;350]</span>
it might be of use to Lord Aberdeen to put him in possession of
her feelings on the state of Spain, in which the Queen has always
taken a very warm interest.</p>

<p class="ind">Here one is exactly shut up as if one was in a menagerie,
walking round and round like a tame bear. One breathes here
also a mixture of all sorts of moist compounds, which one is
told is fresh air, but which is not the least like it. I suppose,
however, that my neighbour in Holland, where they have not
even got a hill as high as yours in Buckingham Gardens, would
consider Laeken as an Alpine country. The tender meeting
of the old King and the new King,<sup>141</sup> as one can hardly call him
a young King, must be most amusing. I am told that if the
old King had not made that love-match, he would be perfectly
able to dethrone his son; I heard that yesterday from a person
rather attached to the son and hating the father. In the
meantime, though one can hardly say that he is well at home,
some strange mixture of cut-throats and ruined soldiers of
fortune had a mind to play us some tricks here; we have got
more and more insight into this. Is it by instigation from him
personally, or does he only know of it without being a party to
it? That <i>is</i> difficult to tell, the more so as he makes immense
demonstration of friendly dispositions towards us, and me in
particular. I would I could make a <i>chassez croisez</i> with Otho;<sup>142</sup>
he would be the gainer in solids, and I should have sun and an

<p class="indright"><i>25th October 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">With respect to the appointment of Chief Justice of the
Queen's Bench, the Queen approves of Mr Pennefather<sup>143</sup> for
that office. The Queen may be mistaken, for she is not very
well acquainted with the judicial officers in Ireland, but it
strikes her that Serjeant Jackson belonged to the very violent
Orange party in Ireland, and if this should be the case she
suggests to Sir Robert Peel whether it would not be better <i>not</i>
to appoint him. If, on the other hand, the Queen should be
mistaken as to his political opinions, she would not disapprove
of his succeeding Mr Pennefather.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen saw in the papers that Lord Stuart de Rothesay
is already gone. The Queen can hardly believe this, as no
Ambassador or Minister <i>ever</i> left England without previously
asking for an Audience and receiving one, as the Queen wishes
always to see them before they repair to their posts. Would
Sir Robert be so very good as to ask Lord Aberdeen whether
Lord Stuart de Rothesay is gone or not, and if he should be, to
tell Lord Aberdeen that in future she would wish him always
to inform her when they intend to go, and to ask for an Audience,
which, if the Queen is well, she would always grant. It
is possible that as the Queen said the other day that she did not
wish to give many Audiences after the Council, that Lord
Aberdeen may have misunderstood this and thought the Queen
would give none, which was <i>not</i> her intention. The Queen
would be thankful to Sir Robert if he would undertake to clear
up this mistake, which she is certain (should Lord Stuart be
gone) arose entirely from misapprehension.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen also wishes Sir Robert to desire Lord Haddington
to send her some details of the intended reductions in the Fleet
which she sees by a draft of Lord Aberdeen's to Mr Bulwer have
taken place.<sup>144</sup></p>

<span class="rightnote">STOCKMAR AND MELBOURNE</span>

<p class="indright"><i>25th October 1841</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">... I told [Lord Melbourne] that, as I read the English
Constitution, it meant to assign to <i>the Sovereign in his functions</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.353" id="pagei.353"></a>[page&nbsp;353]</span>
<i>a deliberative part</i>&mdash;that I was not sure the Queen had the
means within herself to execute this deliberative part properly,
but I was sure that the only way for her to execute her functions
at all was to be strictly honest to those men who at the
time being were her Ministers. That it was chiefly on this
account that I had been so very sorry to have found now, on my
return from the Continent, that on the change of the Ministry
a capital opportunity to read a great Constitutional maxim
to the Queen had not only been lost by Lord Melbourne, but
that he had himself turned an instrument for working great
good into an instrument which must produce mischief and
danger. That I was afraid that, from what Lord Melbourne
had been so weak as to have allowed himself to be driven into,
<i>against his own and better conviction</i>, the Queen must have
received a most pernicious bias, which on any future occasion
would make her inclined to act in a similar position similarly
to that what she does now, being convinced that what she does
<i>now</i> must be right on all future occasions, or else Lord Melbourne
would not have sanctioned it. Upon this, Lord Melbourne
endeavoured to palliate, to represent the danger, which
would arise from his secret correspondence with the Queen as
very little, to adduce precedents from history, and to screen his
present conduct behind what he imagined Lord Bute's conduct
had been under George III.<sup>145</sup> I listened patiently, and replied
in the end: All this might be mighty fine and quite calculated
to lay a flattering unction on his own soul, or it might suffice to
tranquillize the minds of the Prince and Anson, but that I was
too old to find the slightest argument in what I had just now
heard, nor could it in any way allay my apprehension. I
began then to dissect all that he had produced for his excusation,
and showed him&mdash;as I thought clearly, and as he admitted
convincingly&mdash;that it would be impossible to carry on this
secret commerce with the Sovereign for any length of time
without exposing the Queen's character and creating mighty
embarrassments in the quiet and regular working of a Constitutional
machine.</p>
<span class="rightnote">STOCKMAR'S ADVICE</span>
<p class="ind2">My representations seemed to make a very deep impression,
and Lord Melbourne became visibly nervous, perplexed, and
distressed. After he had recovered a little I said, "I never
was inclined to obtrude advice; but if you don't dislike to hear
my opinion, I am prepared to give it to you." He said, "What
is it?" I said, "You allow the Queen's confinement to pass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.354" id="pagei.354"></a>[page&nbsp;354]</span>
over quietly, and you wait till her perfect recovery of it. As
soon as this period has arrived, you state of your own accord to
Her Majesty that this secret and confidential correspondence
with her must cease; that you gave in to it, much against your
feelings, and with a decided notion of its impropriety and danger,
and merely out of a sincere solicitude to calm Her Majesty's
mind in a critical time, and to prevent the ill effects which great
and mental agitation might have produced on her health. That
this part of your purpose now being most happily achieved,
you thought yourself in duty bound to advise Her Majesty to
<i>cease all her communications</i> to you on political subjects, as you
felt it wrong within yourself to receive them, and to return your
political advice and opinions on such matters; that painful
as such a step must be to your feelings, which to the last
moment of your life will remain those of the most loyal attachment
and devotion to the Queen's person, it is dictated to you
by a deep sense of what you owe to the country, to your
Sovereign, and to yourself."</p>

<p class="ind">... Sir Robert Peel humbly assures your Majesty that he
fully participates in the surprise which your Majesty so naturally
expresses at the extraordinary intimation conveyed to
Mr Fox<sup>146</sup> by the President of the United States.<sup>147</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Immediately after reading Mr Fox's despatch upon that
subject, Sir Robert Peel sought an interview with Lord Aberdeen.
The measure contemplated by the President is a
perfectly novel one, a measure of a hostile and unjustifiable
character adopted with pacific intentions.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel does not comprehend the object of the
President, and giving him credit for the desire to prevent the
interruption of amicable relations with this country, Sir Robert
Peel fears that the forcible detention of the British Minister,
after the demand of passports, will produce a different impression
on the public mind, both here and in the United States,
from that which the President must (if he be sincere) have
anticipated. It appears to Sir Robert Peel that the object
which the President professes to have in view would be better
answered by the immediate compliance with Mr Fox's demand
for passports, and the simultaneous despatch of a special
mission to this country conveying whatever explanations or
offers of reparation the President may have in contemplation.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel humbly assures your Majesty that he has
advised such measures of preparation to be taken in respect
to the amount of disposable naval force, and the position of it,
as without bearing the character of menace or causing needless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.356" id="pagei.356"></a>[page&nbsp;356]</span>
disquietude and alarm, may provide for an unfavourable issue
of our present differences with the United States.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel fears that when the President ventured to
make to Mr Fox the communication which he did make, he
must have laboured under apprehension that M'Leod might
be executed in spite of the efforts of the general Government
of the United States to save his life.</p>

boarded by Canadian loyalists when lying in American waters, set on fire and sent over
Niagara Falls, and in the affray Durfee was killed. M'Leod was apprehended on American
territory, and hence arose the friction between the two countries. M'Leod was acquitted

<p class="ind">How the power of Prime Ministry grew up into its present
form it is difficult to trace precisely, as well as how it became
attached, as it were, to the office of First Commissioner of the
Treasury. But Lord Melbourne apprehends that Sir Robert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.357" id="pagei.357"></a>[page&nbsp;357]</span>
Walpole was the first man in whose person this union of powers
was decidedly established, and that its being so arose from the
very great confidence which both George I. and George II.
reposed in him, and from the difficulty which they had in
transacting business, particularly George I., from their imperfect
knowledge of the language of the country.</p>

<p class="ind">With respect to the Secretary of State, Lord Melbourne is
not prepared from memory to state the dates at which the
different arrangements of that office have taken place. There
was originally but one officer, and at the present the three are
but the heads of the different departments of one office. The
first division was into two, and they were called the Secretary
for the Northern and the Secretary for the Southern department.
They drew a line across the world, and each transacted
the business connected with the countries within his own
portion of the globe. Another division then took place, and
the Foreign affairs were confided to one Secretary of State, and
the Home and Colonial affairs to the other; but the present
arrangement was finally settled in the year 1793, when the
junction was formed between Mr Pitt on the one hand, and
those friends of Mr Fox who left him because they differed
with him upon the French Revolution. The Home affairs
were placed in the hands of one Secretary of State, the Foreign
of another, and the Colonial and Military affairs of a third, and
this arrangement has continued ever since.<sup>149</sup> The persons then
appointed were the Duke of Portland,<sup>150</sup> Lord Grenville,<sup>151</sup> and
Mr Dundas,<sup>152</sup> Home, Foreign, and Colonial Secretaries.</p>

<p class="ind">Writing from recollection, it is very possible that Lord
Melbourne may be wrong in some of the dates which he has
ventured to specify.<sup>153</sup></p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">South Street</span>, <i>4th November 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He has this morning had the honour and pleasure of receiving
your Majesty's letter of yesterday....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne sends a letter which he has received from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.358" id="pagei.358"></a>[page&nbsp;358]</span>
his sister, which may not be unentertaining. Lady Palmerston
is struck, as everybody is who goes to Ireland, with the candid
warmth and vehement demonstration of feeling. England
always appears cold, heartless, and sulky in comparison....</p>

<p class="ind">With respect to the questions put to me by your Majesty
at the desire of His Royal Highness, Lord Melbourne begs
leave to assure your Majesty that he will be at all times most
ready and anxious to give any information in his power upon
points of this sort, which are very curious, very important,
very worthy to be enquired into, and upon which accurate
information is not easily to be found. All the political part of
the English Constitution is fully understood, and distinctly
stated in Blackstone and many other books, but the Ministerial
part, the work of conducting the executive government,
has rested so much on practice, on usage, on understanding,
that there is no publication to which reference can be made
for the explanation and description of it. It is to be sought
in debates, in protests, in letters, in memoirs, and wherever it
can be picked up. It seems to be stupid not to be able to say
at once when two Secretaries of State were established; but
Lord Melbourne is not able. He apprehends that there was
but one until the end of Queen Anne's reign, and that two
were instituted by George I., probably because upon his frequent
journeys to Hanover he wanted the Secretary of State
with him, and at the same time it was necessary that there
should be an officer of the same authority left at home to
transact the domestic affairs.</p>

<p class="ind"><i>Prime Minister</i> is a term belonging to the last century.
Lord Melbourne doubts its being to be found in English Parliamentary
language previously. Sir Robert Walpole was
always accused of having introduced and arrogated to himself
an office previously unknown to the Law and Constitution,
that of Prime or Sole Minister, and we learn from Lady Charlotte
Lindsay's<sup>154</sup> accounts of her father, that in his own family
Lord North would never suffer himself to be called <i>prime</i>
Minister, because it was an office unknown to the Constitution.
This was a notion derived from the combined Whig and Tory
opposition to Sir Robert Walpole, to which Lord North and his
family had belonged.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is very sorry to hear that the Princess
Royal continues to suffer from some degree of indisposition.
From what your Majesty had said more than once before,
Lord Melbourne had felt anxiety upon this subject, and he saw
the Baron yesterday, who conversed with him much upon it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.359" id="pagei.359"></a>[page&nbsp;359]</span>
and informed him of what had taken place. Lord Melbourne
hopes that your Majesty will attribute it only to Lord Melbourne's
anxious desire for the security and increase of your
Majesty's happiness, if he ventures to say that the Baron
appears to him to have much reason in what he urges, and in
the view which he takes. It is absolutely required that confidence
should be reposed in those who are to have the management
and bear the responsibility, and that they should not be
too much interrupted or interfered with.</p>

Not feeling satisfied of the correctness of the information which
he had given to your Majesty respecting the office of Secretary
of State, he yesterday evening requested Mr Allen<sup>155</sup> to look
into the matter, and he has just received from him the enclosed
short memorandum, which he has the honour of transmitting

Secretaries of State were first employed, and that it was much
earlier than he had imagined.</p>

the time which Lord Melbourne stated.</p>

<p class="ind">... Your Majesty asks whether Lord Melbourne thinks that
Prince Metternich holds the opinion of Sir Robert Gordon,
which he expresses to Lord Beauvale. It is difficult to say
what Prince Metternich's real sentiments are. Lord Melbourne
takes him not to have a very high opinion of the
abilities of others in general, and he is not unlikely to depreciate
Sir Robert Gordon to Lord Beauvale. Sir Robert
Gordon is a man of integrity, but he is tiresome, long and
pompous, which cannot be agreeable to the Prince, who has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.360" id="pagei.360"></a>[page&nbsp;360]</span>
about him much of the French vivacity, and also much of their
settled and regular style of argument....</p>

<p class="ind">With respect to the latter part of your Majesty's letter, Lord
Melbourne returns for the expressions of your Majesty's kindness
his warm and grateful thanks. Your Majesty may rest
assured that he will always speak to your Majesty without
scruple or reserve, and that he will never ask anything of your
Majesty, or ever make a suggestion, which he does not consider
to be for your Majesty's service and advantage. Lord Melbourne
is of opinion that his visits to the Palace should not
only avoid exciting suspicion and uneasiness in your Majesty's
present advisers, a result of which he has very little apprehension,
but they should not be so frequent as to attract
public notice, comment, and observation, of which he would be
more fearful. A public rumour, however unfounded and
absurd, has more force in this country than objections which
have in them more of truth and reality. Upon these grounds,
and as your Majesty will probably not see much company at
present, and the parties therefore will be a good deal confined
to the actual Household, Lord Melbourne thinks it would perhaps
be as well if he were not again to dine at the Palace at
present.</p>

<p class="ind">The course which it may be prudent to take hereafter will
depend very much upon that which cannot now be foreseen,
namely, upon the general course which will be taken by politics
and political parties. In this Lord Melbourne does not at
present discern his way, and he will not therefore hazard
opinions which would not be founded upon any certainty, and
might be liable to immediate change and alteration.</p>

<p class="indright"><i>23 November 1841</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">The apprehension which haunts me since my return to
England is well known to you. It was my intention to have
written to you upon it some time hereafter, but the contents
of a certain letter, sent by you just before your departure,
accelerates the execution of my design. From your own expressions
used some time back, I was led to expect that you
would be glad to take advantage <i>of any fair opportunity</i> which
might contribute towards that devoutly to be wished for
object, viz., to let a certain correspondence die a natural death.
You may easily conceive how much I felt disappointed when I
heard that you had written again, without a challenge, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.361" id="pagei.361"></a>[page&nbsp;361]</span>
that, without apparent cause, you had volunteered the promise
to write from time to time. This happens at a moment when
<i>your</i> harassing apprehension received new life and strength
from two incidents which I think it my duty to make known to
you, and of which the one came to pass <i>before</i>, the other after,
your departure from here. Some weeks back I was walking
in the streets with Dr Pr&aelig;torius,<sup>156</sup> when, finding myself opposite
the house of one of my friends, it came across my mind
to give him a call. Pr&aelig;torius wanted to leave me, on a conception
that, as a stranger, he might obstruct the freedom of
our conversation. I insisted, however, on his remaining with
me, and we were shown into the drawing-room, where in all
there were five of us. For some minutes the conversation had
turned on insignificant things, when the person talking to me
said quite abruptly: "So I find the Queen is in daily correspondence
with Lord Melbourne." I replied, "Who told you
this?" The answer was, "Mrs Norton; she told me the
other evening. Don't you believe that Lord Melbourne has
lost his influence over the Queen's mind; he daily writes to
her, and receives as many answers, in which she communicates
everything to him." Without betraying much emotion I said,
"I don't believe a word of it; the Queen may have written
once or twice on private matters, but the daily correspondence
on all matters is certainly the amplification of a thoughtless
and imprudent person, who is not aware of such exaggerated
assertions." My speech was followed by a general silence,
after which we talked of other things, and soon took our leave.
When we were fairly in the open air, Pr&aelig;torius expressed to me
his amazement at what he had heard, and he remained for
some time at a loss to comprehend the character of the person
who, from mere giddiness, let out so momentous a secret.</p>

<p class="ind2">The other fact took place the day after you had left. From
the late events at Brussels, it had become desirable that I
should see Sir Robert Peel. From Belgium we travelled over
to Home politics. I expressed my delight at seeing the Queen
so happy, and added a hope that more and more she would
seek and find her real happiness in her domestic relations only.
He evidently caught at this, and assured me that he should at
all times be too happy to have a share in anything which might
be thought conducive to the welfare of Her Majesty. That no
consideration of personal inconvenience would ever prevent
him from indulging the Queen in all her wishes relating to
matters of a private nature, and that the only return for his
sincere endeavours to please Her Majesty he looked to, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.362" id="pagei.362"></a>[page&nbsp;362]</span>
honesty in public affairs. Becoming then suddenly emphatic,
he continued, "But on this I must insist, and I do assure you,
that that moment I was to learn that the Queen takes advice
upon public matters in another place, I shall throw up; for
such a thing I conceive the country could not stand, and I
would not remain an hour, whatever the consequences of my
resignation may be."</p>

<p class="ind2">Fully sensible that he was talking at me, I received the
charge with the calmness of a good conscience, and our time
being exhausted I prepared for retreat. But he did not allow
me to do so, before he had found means to come a second time
to the topic uppermost in his own mind, and he repeated, it
appeared to me with increased force of tone, his determination
to throw up, fearless of all consequences, that moment he
found himself and the country dishonestly dealt by.</p>
<span class="rightnote">STOCKMAR'S EXPOSTULATIONS</span>
<p class="ind2">I think I have now reported to you correctly the two occurrences
which of late have added so much to my antecedent
suspicions and fears. Permit me to join to this a few general
considerations which, from the nature of the recited incidents
alone, and without the slightest intervention of any other
cause, must have presented themselves to my mind. The first
is, that I derive from the events related quite ground enough
for concluding that the danger I dread is great and imminent,
and that, if ill luck is to have its will, no human power can
prevent an explosion for a day, or even for an hour. The
second is the contemplation&mdash;what state will the Queen be
placed in by such a catastrophe? That in my position, portraying
to myself all the consequences of such a possibility, I
look chiefly to the Queen, needs hardly, I trust, an excuse....
Can you hope that the Queen's character will ever recover from
a shock received by a collision with Peel, upon such a cause?
Pray illustrate to yourself this particular question by taking
a purely political and general survey of the time and period
we live in at this moment. In doing so must you not admit
that all England is agreed that the Tories must have another
trial, and that there is a decided desire in the nation that it
should be a fair one? Would you have it said that Sir Robert
Peel failed in his trial, merely because the Queen alone was not
fair to him, and that principally you had aided her in the game
of dishonesty? And can you hope that this game can be
played with security, even for a short time only, when a person
has means of looking into your cards whom you yourself have
described to me some years ago as a most passionate, giddy,
imprudent and dangerous woman? I am sure beforehand
that your loyalty and devotion has nothing to oppose to the
force of my exposition. There are, however, some other and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.363" id="pagei.363"></a>[page&nbsp;363]</span>
minor reasons which ought likewise to be considered before you
come to the determination of trusting entirely to possibilities
and chance. For the results of your deliberation you will
have to come to will in their working and effects go beyond
yourself, and must affect two other persons. These will have a
right to expect that your decision will not be taken regardless
of that position, which accidental circumstances have assigned
to them, in an affair the fate of which is placed entirely within
your discretion. This is an additional argument why you
should deliberate very conscientiously. A mistake of yours in
this respect might by itself produce fresh difficulties and have
a complicating and perplexing retro effect upon the existing
ones; because both, seeing that they must be sufferers in the
end, may begin to look only to their own safety, and become
inclined to refuse that passive obedience which till now constitutes
the vehicle of your hazardous enterprize.</p>

<p class="ind2">Approaching the conclusion of this letter, I beg to remind
you of a conversation I had with you on the same subject in
South Street, the 25th of last month.<sup>157</sup>Though you did not
avow it then in direct words, I could read from your countenance
and manner that you assented in your head and heart to
all I had said, and in particular to the advice I volunteered at
the end of my speech. At that time I pointed out to you a
period when I thought a decisive step ought to be taken on
your part. This period seems to me to have arrived. Placing
unreserved confidence into your candour and manliness, I
remain, for ever, very faithfully yours,</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE INFANT PRINCE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Trentham</span>, <i>1st December 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and has had the honour of receiving here your Majesty's
letters of yesterday, by which he learns with sincere pleasure
and satisfaction that your Majesty is so much recovered as
to go to Windsor on so early a day as your Majesty names.
Lord Melbourne hears with great concern that your Majesty
has been suffering under depression and lowness of spirits....
Lord Melbourne well knows how to feel for those who
suffer under it, especially as he has lately had much of it
himself.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is much rejoiced to hear so good an account
of the Heir Apparent and of the Princess Royal, and feels
himself greatly obliged by the information respecting the
intended names and the sponsors. Lord Melbourne supposes
that your Majesty has determined yourself upon the relative
position of the two names, but <i>Edward</i> is a good English
appellation, and has a certain degree of popularity attached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.365" id="pagei.365"></a>[page&nbsp;365]</span>
to it from ancient recollections. Albert is also an old Anglo-Saxon
name&mdash;the same, Lord Melbourne believes, as Ethelred&mdash;but
it has not been so common nor so much in use since
the Conquest. However, your Majesty's feelings, which Lord
Melbourne perfectly understands, must determine this point.
The notion of the King of Prussia<sup>159</sup> gives great satisfaction
here, and will do so with all but Puseyites and Newmanites
and those who lean to the Roman Catholic faith. His strong
Protestant feelings, and his acting with us in the matter of
the Syrian Bishop, have made the King of Prussia highly
popular in this country, and particularly with the more
religious part of the community.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty cannot offer up for the young Prince a more
safe and judicious prayer than that he may resemble his
father. The character, in Lord Melbourne's opinion, depends
much upon the race, and on both sides he has a good chance.
Be not over solicitous about education. It may be able to
do much, but it does not do so much as is expected from it.
It may mould and direct the character, but it rarely alters it.
George IV. and the Duke of York were educated quite like
English boys, by English schoolmasters, and in the manner
and upon the system of English schools. The consequence
was that, whatever were their faults, they were quite Englishmen.
The others, who were sent earlier abroad, and more to
foreign universities, were not quite so much so. The late
king was educated as a sailor, and was a complete sailor....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne will tell your Majesty exactly what he
thinks of John Russell's reply to the Plymouth address. It is
very angry and very bitter, and anger and bitterness are
never very dignified. Lord Melbourne certainly would not
have put in those sarcasms upon the Duke of Wellington and
Sir Robert Peel, for their change of opinion and conduct upon
the Roman Catholic question. But the tone of the rest of the
answer is, in Lord Melbourne's opinion, just and right. We
certainly delivered the affairs of the country into their hands
in a good state, both at home and abroad, and we should be
acting unfairly by ourselves if we did not maintain and assert
this upon every occasion. Lord Melbourne's notion of the
conduct which he has to pursue is, that it should not be aggressive,
but that it must be defensive. He would oppose no
right measures, but he cannot suffer the course of policy which
has been condemned in him to be adopted by others without
observation upon the inconsistency and injustice....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne concludes with again wishing your Majesty
health and happiness, and much enjoyment of the country.</p>

It was a nasty warm and very rainy day, but to-day is very

<span class="rightnote">THE APPROACHING CHRISTENING</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Castle Howard</span>, <i>22nd December 1841</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">... Lord Melbourne will consider himself most highly
honoured by being invited to the christening, and will hold
himself in readiness to attend, whenever it may take place.
He has written to Mr Anson in answer to the letter which he
received from him this morning. Lord Melbourne has been
obliged to consent to receive an address from Derby, and has
fixed Monday the 27th inst. for that purpose. He could have
wished to have avoided this, but it was impossible, and he
must make the best of it that he can, which he conceives will
be effected by conceiving his reply in very guarded terms, and
in a tone defensive of his own administration, but not offensive
to those who have succeeded him....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is very glad to hear of the feelings of the
King of Prussia. For religious matters he is at present very
popular with many in this country, and popularity, though
transient and uncertain, is a good thing while it lasts. The
King of the Belgians should not be surprised or mortified at
the conduct of the King of Holland. We must expect that
people will act according to their nature and feelings. The
Union of Belgium and Holland has been for a long time the
first wish and the daily dream of the House of Orange. It
has been the great object of their lives, and by the separation,
which took place in 1830, they saw their fondest hopes disappointed
and destroyed at once. It must be expected that
under such a state of things, they will be unquiet, and will try
to obtain what they so eagerly desire and have once possessed.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is much rejoiced to hear that your Majesty
is in the enjoyment of such good health. Your Majesty's
observations upon your own situation are in the highest degree
just and prudent, and it is a sign of a right mind and of good
feelings to prize the blessings we enjoy, and not to suffer them
to be too much altered by circumstances, which may not turn
out exactly according to our wishes.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen presents his most humble duty to your
Majesty. He ventures to request your Majesty's attention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.368" id="pagei.368"></a>[page&nbsp;368]</span>
for a moment to the character of your Majesty's present
relations with the Government of the United States. Your
Majesty is aware that several questions of great difficulty and
importance have been long pending between the two Governments.<sup>161</sup>
Some of these have become more complicated than
they were ten years ago; and any of them might, at any
moment, lead to consequences of the most disastrous nature.</p>

<p class="ind">Instead of continuing negotiations, necessarily tedious and
which promise to be interminable, your Majesty's servants are
humbly of opinion that an effort ought to be made, by a
Special Mission at Washington, to bring all these differences
promptly to an adjustment. The public feeling in the United
States at this time does not appear to be unfavourable for
such an attempt. Should it be undertaken by a person whose
rank, character, and abilities would ensure respect, and whose
knowledge of the subjects under discussion, and of the people
of the country, together with his conciliatory manners, would
render him generally acceptable, your Majesty might perhaps
indulge the hope of a successful result.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen humbly ventures to think that such a
person may be found in Lord Ashburton,<sup>162</sup> whom he submits
for your Majesty's gracious approbation.</p>


<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 161: The question of the North-West Boundary had long been one source of dispute;

<span class="rightnote">CHRISTMAS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>26th December 1841</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind2">Christmas has brought its usual routine of festivity and its
agreeable accompaniment of Christmas presents. The Queen
was not at all well again yesterday, being again troubled with
lowness. The Melbourne correspondence still is carried on,
but I think not in its pristine vigour by any means. He has
taken no notice of the Baron's remonstrance to him, and we
are in the dark in what manner, if at all, he means to deal
with it.</p>

<p class="ind2">I have sat by Her Majesty at dinner several times lately.
I should say that Her Majesty interests herself less and less
about politics, and that her dislike is less than it was to her
present Ministers, though she would not be prepared to acknowledge
it. Her Majesty is a good deal occupied with the
little Princess Royal, who begins to assume companionable
qualities. In the evening, instead of her usual conversation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.369" id="pagei.369"></a>[page&nbsp;369]</span>
with her old Prime Minister, some round game at cards is
substituted, which always terminates at eleven. The Prince,
to amuse the Queen at this, has nearly left off his chess; his
amusements&mdash;shooting or hunting&mdash;always commence and
terminate between eleven and two, not to interfere with Her
Majesty's arrangements, in which he is included as her companion.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He received here yesterday your Majesty's letter of the 25th

Christmas devices, and Lord Melbourne begs to offer to your
Majesty, most sincerely and most fervently, the good wishes
of the Season. Lord Melbourne will be in town on Friday
evening next, and after that day will wait upon your Majesty,
whenever your Majesty is pleased to command....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is very glad to hear that the King of the

<p class="ind">The railway smash<sup>163</sup> is awful and tremendous, as all railway
mishaps are, and Lord Melbourne fears must always be.
These slips and falls of earth from the banks are the greatest
danger that now impends over them, and if they take place
suddenly and in the dark, Lord Melbourne does not see how
the fatal consequences of them are to be effectually guarded
against. They are peculiarly likely to happen now, as the
cuttings have been recently and hastily made, the banks are
very steep, and the season has been peculiarly wet, interrupted
by severe frosts.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne received the deputation from Derby, a
large and respectable one, here on Monday last. The address
was very guarded, temperate, and judicious, and Lord Melbourne
strove to construct his answer in the same manner.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5em;">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>

<h3 style="margin-top: -0.5em;">TO CHAPTER XI</h3>


<p><span class="sc">The</span> session was mainly occupied by the great Ministerial measure
of finance, direct taxation by means of income tax being imposed,
and the import duties on a large number of articles being removed
or relaxed, Mr Gladstone, now at the Board of Trade, taking charge
of the bills. Two more attempts on the Queen's life were made, the
former again on Constitution Hill by one Francis, whose capital
sentence was commuted; the latter by a hunchback, Bean, who
was sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment. An Act was
promptly passed to deal with such outrages in future as misdemeanours,
without giving them the importance of high treason.
Lord Ashley's Bill was passed, prohibiting woman and child labour
in mines and collieries. But the Anti-Corn Law League of Manchester
was not satisfied with the policy of the Government and
objected to the income tax; while riots broke out in the manufacturing
districts of the North.</p>

<p>In Afghanistan, the disasters of the previous year were retrieved;
Sir Robert Sale, who was gallantly defending Jellalabad, made a
<i>sortie</i> and defeated Akbar Khan; General Nott arrived at Ghuznee,
but found it evacuated; he destroyed the citadel and removed the
Gates of Somnauth. General Pollock swept the Khyber Pass and
entered Cabul. The captives taken on the retreat from Cabul were
recovered&mdash;Lady Macnaghten and Lady Sale among them. In
retribution for the murder of Macnaghten, the great bazaar of
Cabul, where his remains had been dishonoured, was destroyed by
Pollock; the British force was then withdrawn. Dost Mahommed
made himself again ruler of Cabul, and a proclamation of Lord
Ellenborough announced that the British Government accepted any
Sovereign and Constitution approved by the Afghans themselves.</p>

<p>In China, also, operations were successfully terminated, Chapoo
being taken in May, and an attack by Admiral Parker upon Nanking
being only averted by the conclusion of a favourable treaty, involving
an indemnity, the cession by China of Hong Kong, and the opening
of important ports to commerce.</p>

<p>A dispute had arisen between this country and the United States as
to the boundary line between the latter country and the British
Possessions in North America. Lord Ashburton was accordingly
sent out on a special mission to effect the adjustment of this and
other disputes, and a treaty was concluded for the purpose of
defining each country's territorial rights, and imposing mutual
obligations for the suppression of the Slave Trade.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dear Niece</span>,&mdash;Most grateful for your very amiable kind
letter full of good wishes for me, I hasten to answer it and to
assure you that I deeply feel all your affectionate kindness to
me in wishing my life to be prolonged. From ill-health I have
become such a useless member of your family, that I must
wonder you have not long been tired of me. I wish I was
more able to be of any use to you which you might like to make
of me. My services would be most faithful, I can assure you.
Should my life be spared, there may perhaps yet be a time
when I can prove to you, that what I say is not merely a <i>fa&ccedil;on
de parler</i>, but my sincere wish.</p>

<p class="ind">Your domestic happiness, dearest Victoria, gives me great
satisfaction whenever I think of it, and that is very often.
God continue it so, uninterrupted, is my daily prayer.</p>

<p class="ind">Your approbation of my little offering to my dear godchild
gives me much pleasure. It occupied me several days during
my illness to make the drawing, weak as I then was, and it
was a <i>pleasant occupation</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">We have frost again, with a clear blue sky, which is much
better for me than the damp close weather of last week, which
oppressed me so much. I breathe again, and my spirits get
their usual tone, which they had lost, but I still cough a great
deal, which is very fatiguing.</p>

<p class="ind">Will you kiss your darlings in my name and bless them,
and pray believe me ever, my dear Niece, your most affectionately
devoted Aunt,</p>

his thanks for all the kindness shown him at Windsor.
He was very happy to find himself there again and in your
Majesty's society. He has seen many fine places and much
fine country, but after all there is nothing like Windsor and
the Park. Twenty very fine places might easily be made out
of the latter. Lord Melbourne as he drove to Bagshot was
very glad to see the plantations at and about Cumberland
Lodge and onwards so well and judiciously thinned. He had
a very prosperous journey here. It is a lovely place, with the
greatest beauty that a place can have, a very swift, clear,
natural stream, running and winding in front of the house.
The whole place is much improved since Lord Melbourne saw
it last; a great deal of new pleasure-ground has been made.
The trees, cypresses, elders, planes, elms, white poplars and
acacias are very fine indeed....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne thinks of staying here six or seven days,
and then returning to London and going to Brocket Hall and
Panshanger, but he has not fixed his plans decidedly, which he
is never very fond of doing.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne was delighted at thinking that he left your
Majesty in good health, which he earnestly hopes and fervently
prays may, together with every other blessing, long continue.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Fitzgerald, with his most humble duty to your Majesty,
begs leave humbly to inform your Majesty that despatches
have been this day received at the India House from the Earl
of Auckland, Governor-General of India, which most officially
confirm to too great an extent the disastrous intelligence contained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.373" id="pagei.373"></a>[page&nbsp;373]</span>
in the public journals of yesterday, the particulars of
which the editors of these journals had received by express
messengers from Marseilles.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p class="ind">This intelligence is of a most painful character, and though
the details which have arrived do high honour to the courage
and the gallantry of your Majesty's forces, as well as of the
East India Company's Army, yet the loss sustained has been
very great, and many valuable officers have fallen the victims
of a widespread conspiracy which seems to have embraced
within its confederation the most warlike tribes of the Afghan
nation.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Fitzgerald begs leave most humbly to lay before your
Majesty an interesting despatch from Lord Auckland, comprising
the most important details of the late events in
Afghanistan.</p>

<p class="ind">It is very satisfactory to Lord Fitzgerald to be enabled
humbly to acquaint your Majesty that Lord Auckland has
decided on waiting the arrival of his successor, Lord Ellenborough,
and states to Lord Fitzgerald that he will feel it to
be his duty to remain in his [Government], in the present
critical state of affairs, until he is relieved by the new Governor-General.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Broadlands</span>, <i>12th January 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He has this morning received your Majesty's letter of the 10th
inst., and is glad to infer from it that your Majesty and the
Prince are both well and in good spirits.</p>

<p class="ind">With respect to the Oxford affair, your Majesty is aware that
for a long time a serious difference has been fermenting and
showing itself in the Church of England, one party leaning back
towards Popery, and the other either wishing to keep doctrines
as they are, or, perhaps, to approach somewhat nearer to the
dissenting Churches. This difference has particularly manifested
itself in a publication, now discontinued, but which has
been long going on at Oxford, entitled <i>Tracts for the Times</i>,
and generally called the Oxford Tracts. The Professorship of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.374" id="pagei.374"></a>[page&nbsp;374]</span>
Poetry is now vacant at Oxford, and two candidates have been
put forward, the one Mr Williams, who is the author of one or
two of the most questionable of the Oxford Tracts, and the
other Mr Garbett, who is a representative of the opposite party.
Of course the result of this election, which is made by the
Masters of Arts of the University, is looked to with much
interest and anxiety, as likely to afford no unequivocal sign of
which is the strongest party in the University and amongst
the clergy generally. It is expected that Mr Garbett will
be chosen by a large majority....</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE MORNING CHRONICLE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">South Street</span>, <i>17th January 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and begs to acknowledge your Majesty's letter of the 15th,
which he has received here this morning.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne does not think this Puseyite difference in
the Church so serious or dangerous as others do. If it is discreetly
managed, it will calm down or blow over or sink into
disputes of little significance. All Lord Melbourne fears is
lest the Bishops should be induced to act hastily and should
get into the wrong. The Puseyites have the most learning, or
rather, have considered the points more recently and more
accurately than their opponents.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne hopes that the Spanish affair will be settled.
Lord Melbourne cannot doubt that the French are wrong.
Even if the precedents are in their favour, the Spanish Court
has a right to settle its own etiquette and its own mode of
transacting business, and to change them if it thinks proper.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne was at Broadlands when the Article to
which your Majesty alludes appeared in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>,
and he talked it over with Palmerston. He does not think
that Palmerston wrote it, because there were in it errors, and
those errors to Palmerston's disadvantage; but it was written
by Easthope under the impression that it conveyed Palmerston's
notions and opinions. Your Majesty knows very
well that Palmerston has long had much communication with
the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> and much influence over it, and has
made great use of it for the purpose of maintaining and defending
his own policy. In this sort of matter there is much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.375" id="pagei.375"></a>[page&nbsp;375]</span>
to be said upon both sides. A Minister has a great advantage
in stating his own views to the public, and if Palmerston in the
Syrian affair had not had as devoted an assistant as the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i>, he would hardly have been able to maintain his
course or carry through his measures. It has always been
Lord Melbourne's policy to keep himself aloof from the public
press and to hold it at arm's-length, and he considers it the best
course, but it is subject to disadvantages. You are never in that
case strongly supported by them, nor are the motives and
reasons of your conduct given to the public with that force
and distinctness which they might be.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne has no doubt that your Majesty's assurance
is well founded, and that the present Government are
anxious for the welfare and prosperity and tranquillity of
Spain. It cannot be otherwise.</p>

<p class="ind">Palmerston dislikes Aberdeen and has a low opinion of him.
He thinks him weak and timid, and likely to let down the
character and influence of the country. Your Majesty knows
that Lord Melbourne does not partake these opinions, certainly
not at least to anything like the extent to which
Palmerston carries them.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is going down to Panshanger to-morrow,
where he understands that he is to meet Lord and Lady
Lansdowne and Lord and Lady Leveson.<sup>5</sup> Lord Melbourne
will take care and say nothing about Brighton, but is glad to
hear that your Majesty is going thither.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen cannot say <i>how grieved</i> she is, and the Prince also,
at hearing of Lord Melbourne's serious indisposition, by his
letter this morning. How <i>very</i> provoking if he cannot come on
Tuesday. It will be the <i>only</i> important ceremony during the

If Lord Melbourne should soon get well we shall hope

<span class="rightnote">THE SLAVE TRADE</span>

<p class="indright"><i>28th January 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen presents his most humble duty to your
Majesty. Some time ago, your Majesty was graciously pleased
to express a desire to have a copy of the Treaty concluded by
your Majesty with the Four Great Powers of Europe, for the
more effectual suppression of the Slave Trade.<sup>8</sup> Lord Aberdeen
has had one prepared for your Majesty's use, which he humbly
begs to lay before your Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">In obeying your Majesty's commands Lord Aberdeen thinks
it his duty, at the same time, to state to your Majesty that,
with the exception of some alterations and additions of little
importance, the Treaty in its present form had existed for a
considerable time in the Foreign Office. He found, also, that
there had been a reluctance to sign it on the part of the French
Government; but as the objection was chiefly of a personal
nature, it was speedily removed. The only share, therefore,
which Lord Aberdeen can properly be said to have had in this
transaction is that of having been enabled to afford your
Majesty the great satisfaction of completing this blessed work
at an earlier period than would otherwise have been the case.</p>

and has to thank your Majesty for the letters of the 28th and
the 31st ult., the last of which he received this morning.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is very glad that your Majesty opens the
Parliament in person. Your Majesty knows Lord Melbourne's
opinion, that it ought always to be done, when it can be, without
reference to Ministers, politics, or political questions. Lord
Melbourne hopes to be able to go to the House in the evening,
but he fears that it would be too much for him if he were to
attempt to attend also in the morning.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.378" id="pagei.378"></a>[page&nbsp;378]</span>
Favourites often get shot; Lord Melbourne has known it
happen often in his time. That is the worst of dogs; they
add another strong interest to a life which has already of itself
interest enough, and those, God knows! sufficiently subject
both to accident and decay.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is sorry to do anything that could trouble
your Majesty in the slightest degree, but he doubts not that
your Majesty is already aware of the matter, and therefore he
has less scruple in sending to your Majesty a letter<sup>10</sup> which he
has received from the Duke of Sussex. Upon the plea of not
being well, Lord Melbourne has put off seeing the Duke upon
this subject until after Monday next, and when he does see him,
he will try to keep him quiet, which your Majesty knows
when he has got a thing of this sort into his head, is no easy
matter.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dear Uncle</span>,&mdash;I have to thank you for a kind, short note
of the 27th inst., which I received on Sunday. I gave your
kind message to the King of Prussia, who was much <i>touch&eacute;</i> by
it. He is a most amiable man, so kind and well-meaning, and
seems so much beloved. He is so amusing too. He is very
anxious that Belgium should become <i>li&eacute;e</i> with Germany, and I
think, dearest Uncle, that it would be for the <i>real</i> good of
Belgium if it could be so. You will have heard how perfectly
and splendidly everything went off on the 25th. Nothing could
have done better, and <i>little</i> Albert (<i>what</i> a pleasure that he has
that <i>dearest</i> name!) behaved so well. The King left us yesterday
morning to go to town, where we follow him to-morrow;
he was quite sad to leave Windsor, which he admired so much.
He dined with the Sutherlands yesterday, and dines with the
Duke of Wellington to-day, and the Cambridges to-morrow.
On Thursday he dines with us (he lodges in Buckingham

<p class="ind">The King of Prussia is a very delightful person;<sup>13</sup> he is so
clever and amiable, and, owing to his good-nature, not by any
means fatiguing. I fear you had cold weather yesterday for
the opening of Parliament. To-day we have here a tremendous
fog; Heaven grant that it may not be so heavy on the Thames!
else the King's journey will be rendered difficult.</p>

<p class="ind">We expect him to-morrow about eleven o'clock; he wishes
to be at Antwerp at five, which would indicate his departure
from hence at three o'clock. There can be no doubt that
nothing could be better than to link this country as much as possible
to Germany. The public feeling was and is still favourable
to this, but in Germany some years ago they were childishly
ultra, and kicked us off most unnecessarily, which renders
everything of the sort now much less easy. In a political point
of view the King's journey will prove useful, as it takes him still
more out of the clutches of Russia and gives him more <i>correct</i>
views of what is going on in the West of Europe.</p>

<p class="ind">I wish the King may also talk to his helter-skelter cousin in
Holland; if the man goes on in his wild intrigues, though he
will get most probably nothing by it <i>himself</i>, he may do a great
deal of harm, and may force us to incline more towards France
for fear of <i>his</i> intrigues with France.</p>

seeing you, if you have time to spare, when you come to town

very happy should you be able to fulfil your kind intention.</p>

<p class="ind">I was happy to hear how well the holy ceremony went off on
Tuesday, and how splendid the whole was. The earnest attention
of the King of Prussia to the ceremony, and the manner
with which he read the responses, was universally remarked
and admired. May your dear child, our beloved Prince of
Wales, follow his pious example in future, and become as truly
estimable and amiable and good as his Godfather really is.
He is indeed most charming, and so very agreeable and affable
to every one, that he must be loved and respected by all who
have the good fortune to approach him. I hope he does not
over-fatigue himself, for he does a great deal in the short time
of his stay in England. He expresses himself delighted with
his reception.</p>

described her to me as the most lovely child he ever saw.</p>

this evening in the House of Commons a resolution condemnatory
of the principle of the plan for the adjustment of the
Corn Laws, brought forward by your Majesty's servants.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord John Russell was followed in the debate by Mr Gladstone,
the Vice-President of the Board of Trade, who vindicated
the plan....</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel had a meeting yesterday of the friends of the
Government in the House of Commons, and he is convinced
that although many may have wished that the plan of the
Government had given an increased degree of protection to

<p class="ind">In conformity with this feeling on my part, I take the liberty

prepared for the information of Her Majesty's servants on the
important subjects respectively of the state of Slavery in the

<p class="ind">Lord Fitzgerald, with his most humble duty to your Majesty,
requests permission humbly to submit to your Majesty, that
the communications received yesterday at the India House
present a dark and alarming picture of the position and danger
of the British troops in Afghanistan.<sup>16</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Although the Governor-General's despatch announcing these
melancholy tidings also states that no strictly official intelligence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.383" id="pagei.383"></a>[page&nbsp;383]</span>
had reached him from Cabul, yet the opinion of Lord
Auckland evidently is, that the reports on which his despatch
is founded are but too likely to be true.</p>

<p class="ind">From them it would appear that a numerous and excited
native population had succeeded in intercepting all supplies,
that the army at Cabul laboured under severe privations, and
that in consequence of the strict investment of the cantonments
by the enemy, there remained, according to a letter from the
late Sir William Macnaghten to an officer with Sir Robert Sale's
force, only three days' provision in the camp.</p>

<p class="ind">Under such circumstances it can perhaps be but faintly hoped
that any degree of gallantry and devotion on the part of your
Majesty's forces can have extricated them from the difficulties
by which they were encompassed on every side.</p>

<p class="ind">Capitulation had been spoken of, and it may, unhappily,
have become inevitable, as the relieving column, expected from
Candahar, had been compelled by the severity of an unusual
season to retrace its march.</p>

<p class="ind">The despatches from Calcutta being voluminous, and embracing
minute unofficial reports, Lord Fitzgerald has extracted
and copied those parts which relate to the military operations
in Afghanistan, and most humbly submits them to your
Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">He at the same time solicits permission to annex a <i>pr&eacute;cis</i> of
some of the most important of the private letters which have
been forwarded from India; and, as your Majesty was graciously
pleased to peruse with interest some passages from the
first journal of Lady Sale, Lord Fitzgerald ventures to add the
further extracts, transmitted by Lord Auckland, in which Lady
Sale describes successive actions with the enemy, and paints
the state of the sufferings of the army, as late as the 9th of
December.</p>

<p class="ind">Nothing contained in any of these communications encourages
the hope of Sir Alexander Burnes's safety. In one letter
the death of an individual is mentioned, who is described as
the assassin of that lamented officer.</p>

<p class="ind">All of which is most humbly submitted to your Majesty by

<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.384" id="pagei.384"></a>[page&nbsp;384]</span>

<p class="ind">Our excursion was most successful and gratifying. It rained
very much all Monday evening at Portsmouth, but, nevertheless,
we visited the <i>St Vincent</i> and the <i>Royal George</i> yacht, and
the Prince went all over the Dockyards.</p>

<p class="ind">It stormed and rained all night, and rained when we set off
on bord the <i>Black Eagle</i> (the <i>Firebrand</i> that was) for Spithead
on Tuesday morning; it, however, got quite fine when we got
there, and we went on board the <i>Queen</i>, and a glorious sight it
was; she is a magnificent ship, so wide and roomy, and though
only just commissioned, in the best order. With marines, etc.,
her crew is near upon a thousand men! We saw the men at
dinner, and tasted the grog and soup, which pleased them very
much. Old Sir Edward Owen is very proud of her.</p>

<p class="ind">It was a great pleasure for the Queen to be at sea again, and
not a creature <i>thought</i> even of being sick. The saluting of all
those great ships in the harbour at once, as we came out and
returned, has a splendid effect.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen was also much pleased at seeing four of the crew
of the <i>Emerald</i> again whom she knew so well <i>nine years</i> ago!
The Prince was delighted with all he saw, as were also our
Uncle and Cousins; these last, we are sorry to say, leave us on
Monday,&mdash;and we go up to Town on Tuesday, where the Queen
hopes to see Lord Melbourne soon.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen sends Lord Melbourne a letter from the Queen of
Portugal, all which tends to show how <i>wrong</i> it is to <i>think</i> that
they connive at the restoration of the Charter....</p>

<p class="ind">Lady Dunmore is in waiting, and makes an excellent Lady-in-Waiting.
Lord Hardwicke the Queen likes very much, he
seems so straightforward. He took the greatest care of the

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 17: "His father, Sir Joseph Yorke," Lord Melbourne replied, "was drowned in the

to have been struck by lightning. His cousin, Lord Royston, was drowned in the year
1807 in the Baltic, at Cronstadt" [according to Burke in 1808, off Lubeck, <i>&aelig;t</i>. twenty-three],
"which event, together with the death of two younger sons of Lord Hardwicke,
gave the earldom ultimately to the present Lord."

<span class="rightnote">THE FALL OF CABUL</span>

<p class="indright"><i>10th March 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Fitzgerald, with his most humble duty to your Majesty,
begs leave most humbly and with deep sorrow to lay before
your Majesty reports which he has only within this hour
received.</p>

<p class="ind">They are to be found in a despatch from the Governor and
Council of Bombay, and unhappily confirm, to an appalling
degree, the disastrous intelligence from Afghanistan. The
commercial expresses, which reached London yesterday, gave
to the public some of the details of the fall of Cabul; and
Lord Fitzgerald laments that it is his painful duty most
humbly to inform your Majesty that the despatches just
arrived confirm to their full extent the particulars of Sir
William Macnaghten's fate, and of the fate of that remnant
of gallant men who, on the faith of a capitulation, had
evacuated that cantonment which they had defended with
unavailing courage.</p>

<p class="ind">In addition to the despatch from the Council of Bombay,
Lord Fitzgerald humbly ventures to submit to your Majesty
a letter addressed to him by Mr Anderson, the Acting-Governor
of that Presidency, with further details of these melancholy
events.</p>

<p class="ind">The despatches from the Governor-General of India come
down to the date of the 22nd of January (three days previous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.386" id="pagei.386"></a>[page&nbsp;386]</span>
to the tragical death of Sir William Macnaghten). Lord
Auckland was then uninformed of the actual state of the force
in Cabul, though not unprepared for severe reverses.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE GARTER</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Whitehall</span>, <i>20th March 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and will take an opportunity to-morrow of ascertaining your
Majesty's pleasure with respect to the remaining Garter which
still remains undisposed of, as your Majesty may probably
think it advisable that the Investiture of all the Knights
selected for the vacant Garters should take place at the same
time.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel humbly represents to your Majesty that
those Peers who may severally be considered from their rank
and station candidates for this high distinction, have behaved
very well in respect to it, as since Sir Robert Peel has had the
honour of serving your Majesty he has never received, excepting
in the cases of the Duke of Buckingham and recently of
Lord Cardigan, a direct application on the subject of the
Garter.</p>

<p class="ind">Of those who from their position and rank in the Peerage, and
from the Garter having been heretofore conferred on their
ancestors or relations, may be regarded as competitors, the
principal appear to Sir Robert Peel to be the following:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="none1">
   <li>The Duke of Cleveland</li>
  <li>The Duke of Montrose</li>
  <li>The Marquis of Hertford</li>
  <li>The Marquis of Bute</li>
  <li>The Marquis of Abercorn</li>
  <li>The Marquis Camden</li>
  <li>The Marquis of Londonderry.</li>
</ul>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel names all, without meaning to imply that
the pretensions of all are very valid ones. He would humbly
represent for your Majesty's consideration, whether on account
of rank, fortune and general character and station in the
country, the claims of the Duke of Cleveland do not upon the
whole predominate.<sup>18</sup></p>

<p class="ind">His Grace is very much mortified and disappointed at Sir
Robert Peel's having humbly advised your Majesty to apply
the general rule against the son's succeeding the father immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.387" id="pagei.387"></a>[page&nbsp;387]</span>
in the Lieutenancy of a county to his case in reference
to his county of Durham.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel thinks it better to write to your Majesty
upon this subject, as your Majesty may wish to have an
opportunity of considering it.</p>

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">THE EARL OF MUNSTER</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">South Street</span>, <i>21st March 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
A letter from Charles Fox to Lady Holland, and which she has
sent to me, informs me of the shocking end of Munster,<sup>19</sup> which
your Majesty will have heard long before you receive this.
Charles Fox attributes it entirely to the vexatious and uneasy
life which he led with Lady Munster, but he was always, as your
Majesty knows, an unhappy and discontented man, and there
is something in that unfortunate condition of illegitimacy
which seems to distort the mind and feelings and render them
incapable of justice or contentment.</p>

<p class="ind">It is not impossible that upon this event application may be
made to your Majesty for the continuance of the pension upon
the Privy Purse to his son. As Lord Melbourne advised your
Majesty to continue these pensions upon the late King's death,
perhaps it may not be improper that he should now say that
it is his strong opinion that they should not be continued
further. There is no reason for it. They are not very rich,
but neither are they poor, and they have very opulent connections
and relations. It appears to me that the first opportunity
should be taken to show that it is not your Majesty's
intention to charge the Crown with the maintenance and
support of all these families, which will otherwise be the case.
Lord Melbourne thinks it not improper to mention this matter
thus early, as otherwise the [compassionate] feelings naturally
raised by such an event might lead to a different determination.</p>
<span class="rightnote">THE QUEEN AND THE INCOME TAX</span>
<p class="ind">There is another matter mentioned in your Majesty's letter,
relating to money, which is of considerable importance, and
that is the determination taken by your Majesty to subject
your own provision to the proposed duty on income. When it
was put to your Majesty Lord Melbourne is disposed to think
that your Majesty's determination<sup>20</sup> was right, and it certainly
will be very popular, which in the present circumstances of
the country and state of public feelings is a great advantage.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.388" id="pagei.388"></a>[page&nbsp;388]</span>

<p class="ind">At the same time it is giving up a principle of the Constitution,
which has hitherto exempted the Sovereign from all direct
taxation, and there are very great doubts entertained whether
the announcement to Parliament of the intention was not in
a constitutional point of view objectionable, inasmuch as it
pronounced the opinion of the Crown upon a tax which was
still under discussion. It is also a great pecuniary sacrifice,
and, as your Majesty says, together with the loss of the Duchy
of Cornwall and other revenues, will make a great change in
your Majesty's pecuniary circumstances. These defalcations
can only be repaired by care and economy. Your Majesty has
all the most right feelings and the best judgment about money,
and Lord Melbourne has no doubt that your Majesty will so
act as to avoid pecuniary embarrassment&mdash;the only difficulty
which Lord Melbourne fears for your Majesty, and the only
contingency which could involve your Majesty in serious
personal inconvenience.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne thanks your Majesty much for the kindness
of your letter....</p>

<p class="ind">Everybody says that the marriage between Miss Stuart and
Lord Waterford<sup>21</sup> is likely to take place. It is said that he
would do almost anything rather than go to St. Petersburg.
Lord Melbourne has not seen Lord Waterford, but he is said
to be very good-looking; we know him to be rich and of high
rank, and, after all, that sort of character is not disliked by
all ladies. Perhaps also she counts upon the effect of her
influence to soften, to tranquillise, and to restrain.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne hears a very bad account of Lord Anglesey's
affairs. His case is a hard one, for these pecuniary difficulties
are owing to the extravagance of others, and by no means to
his own. Lord Melbourne saw Uxbridge and Ellen at Lady
Palmerston's on Saturday evening. The latter seemed in
good spirits, and said that she did not mean to shut herself up
too closely in Hertfordshire.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne thought that your Majesty would be pleased
with Lambeth. The view from the great window in the
drawing-room over the river, and to the Houses of Parliament
and the Abbey, is very fine indeed, but like all London views can
rarely be seen in consequence of the foggy atmosphere....</p>

<p class="ind">No doubt your Majesty and His Royal Highness must be
anxious for a little quiet and repose, which Lord Melbourne
hopes that your Majesty will enjoy. Lord Melbourne had
feared that your Majesty's health was not quite so good
as it appeared.... Lord Melbourne concludes this very long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.389" id="pagei.389"></a>[page&nbsp;389]</span>
letter with the most fervent expression of his most sincere
wishes for your Majesty's health and happiness.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne in speaking of poor Lord Munster forgot
to mention that at the Lev&eacute;e on Wednesday last he followed
Lord Melbourne down the long gallery as he was going away,
came up to him with great emotion of manner, pressed his hand
warmly, and said that he wished to take the earliest opportunity
of thanking Lord Melbourne for all the kindness he had
shown him whilst he had been in office.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Panshanger</span>, <i>31st March 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He is much rejoiced to learn that your Majesty has had fine
weather and has enjoyed it. It rained here hard yesterday in
the morning, but cleared up about half-past twelve and was
very fine indeed. Lord Melbourne went over to Brocket Hall
and enjoyed it much. He does not intend to return to London
until Monday next, when the House of Lords reassembles. It is
to be hoped that we shall then soon have the Corn Bill up from
the Commons and pass it. The Income Tax will give some
trouble, but that done, and the Poor Law Bill, the end of the
Session may begin to be looked forward to.</p>

<p class="ind">The sale of Strawberry Hill<sup>22</sup> naturally excites interest, and
things are not unlikely to be sold high. The collection has
after all been kept together, and the place has remained in the
family of his niece,<sup>23</sup> the Duchess of Gloucester, to whom he
bequeathed it, longer than he himself expected. He says in
one of his letters that he would send a statue down to Linton,
Sir Horace Mann's place in Kent, because there it had a better
chance of remaining permanently, "for as to this poor bauble
of a place," he adds, "it will be knocked to pieces in a very few
years after my decease." It has stood, however, and remained
five-and-forty years, a longer period than he had anticipated.
Some of the works, such as the bell by Benvenuto Cellini, and
the antique Eagle, are very fine; others are only curious.
Lord Melbourne would not give much money for a mere
curiosity, unless there were also some intrinsic merits or beauty.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.390" id="pagei.390"></a>[page&nbsp;390]</span>

<p class="ind">What is the value of Cardinal Wolsey's cap, for instance? It
was not different from that of any other Cardinal, and a
Cardinal's cap is no great wonder.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne returns Lord Munster's letter. It is without
date, but was evidently written in contemplation of the
dreadful act which he afterwards perpetrated. It is very
melancholy. Lord Melbourne was certain that your Majesty
would send to Lord Adolphus<sup>24</sup> the assurance which you have
done, and that you would be anxious to assist his children, and
promote their interests by every means in your power. But
both their brothers and they must be made sensible that they
must make some effort for themselves.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is very glad to learn that your Majesty
intends to offer the Round Tower<sup>25</sup> to the Duke of Sussex. It is
in every respect kind. It will be of essential service to him, and
it will gratify him most exceedingly.</p>
<span class="rightnote">THE ROYAL GOVERNESS</span>
<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne thinks that your Majesty's decision respecting
the Governess<sup>26</sup> is right. It should be a lady of rank; but
that she should be a woman of sense and discretion, and
capable of fulfilling the duties of the office, is of more importance
than whether she is a Duchess, a Marchioness, or a
Countess. The selection is difficult, but if your Majesty can find
a person, it would not be well to consider either high or low
rank as a disqualification.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne intends to take advantage of his freedom
from the restraints of office in order to see a little of the bloom
of spring and summer, which he has missed for so many years.
He has got one or two horses, which he likes well enough, and
has begun to ride again a little. Lord Melbourne wishes your
Majesty much of the same enjoyment, together with all health,
happiness, and prosperity.</p>

<span class="rightnote">PARTY POLITICS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Brocket Hall</span>, <i>6th April 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and has this morning received your Majesty's very kind and
confidential letter, for which he greatly thanks your Majesty.
Your Majesty may depend upon it that Lord Melbourne will
do everything in his power to discourage and restrain factious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.391" id="pagei.391"></a>[page&nbsp;391]</span>
and vexatious opposition, not only on account of your Majesty's
wish, but because he disapproves it as much as your Majesty
can possibly do. But everything in his power he fears is but
little. The leaders of a party, or those who are so called,
have but little sway over their followers, particularly when
not in Government, and when they have it not in their power
to threaten them with any very serious consequences, such as
the dissolution of the Administration. Mr Pulteney, afterwards
Earl of Bath, is reported to have said that political
parties were like snakes, guided not by their heads, but by
their tails. Lord Melbourne does not know whether this is
true of the snake, but it is certainly so of the party. The
conduct of the Opposition upon the resolution respecting the
Income Tax is rendered peculiarly ridiculous by the result.
They forcibly put it off until after the holidays, and then upon
the first day of the meeting they vote it without a division.
What is this but admitting that they looked to a movement
in the country which they have not been able to create?
Moreover, all Oppositions that Lord Melbourne has ever seen
are more or less factious. The Opposition of Mr Fox to Mr
Pitt was the least so, but these were great men, greater than
any that exist at the present day, although Lord Melbourne
is by no means inclined to depreciate his own times. The
factiousness of one Opposition naturally produces the same
in the next. They say, "They did so to us; why should we
not do so to them?" Your Majesty may rest assured that
Lord Melbourne will do everything he can to prevent delay, and
to accelerate the transaction of the public business.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne sends a letter which he has received this
morning from the Duke of Sussex, and which expresses very
right and proper feeling. Lord Melbourne has written in
reply that, "Your Majesty was no doubt influenced principally
by your natural affection for him, and by your sense of the
generosity of his conduct towards Lord Munster, but that if
any thought of Lord Melbourne intervened, your Majesty could
not have given a higher or a more acceptable proof of your
approbation and regard."</p>
<span class="rightnote">THE GARTER</span>
<p class="ind">The Garters<sup>27</sup> seem to Lord Melbourne to be given well
enough. Your Majesty's feelings upon the subject are most
kind and amiable. But these things cannot be helped, and it
is upon the whole advantageous that each party should have
their portion of patronage and honours. If there is very
distinguished service, the Garter should be bestowed upon it.
Otherwise, in Lord Melbourne's opinion, it is better given to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.392" id="pagei.392"></a>[page&nbsp;392]</span>
noblemen of high rank and great property. The chapter in
Ecclesiasticus, read in St George's Chapel on Obiit Sunday,
well describes those who ought to have it, with the exception of
those "who find out musical tunes." Lord Melbourne does
not think it well given to Ministers. It is always then subject
to the imputation of their giving it to themselves, and pronouncing
an approbation of their own conduct.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne hopes that the Pope's standing sponsor for
the young Prince of Portugal is a sign of complete reconciliation
with the See of Rome. It is a very awkward thing for a
Roman Catholic Government to be at variance with the Pope.
He is still a very ugly customer.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is very much concerned to hear of the
Baron's<sup>28</sup> illness&mdash;very much indeed; he is an excellent and
most valuable man, with one of the soundest and coolest
judgments that Lord Melbourne has ever met with. Your
Majesty knows that Lord Melbourne has never had a favourable
opinion of his health. There seems to be about him a
settled weakness of the stomach, which is in fact the seat of
health, strength, thought and life. Lord Melbourne sees that
a great physician says that Napoleon lost the battle of Leipsic
in consequence of some very greasy soup which he ate the day
before, and which clouded his judgment and obscured his
perceptions.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is very glad to hear that your Majesty has
amused yourself so well in the country, and is not surprised
that you are unwilling to quit it. He means himself to see a
little of the coming in of the spring, which he has not done for
many years.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and thanks your Majesty much for your letter of the 17th inst.
Lord Melbourne has been so much occupied with the debates
in the House of Lords during the last two days, that he has
ventured to put off replying to your Majesty's letters, which he
trusts that your Majesty will excuse.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne did not leave the ball until ten minutes
after one, and as there were so many persons there, which Lord
Melbourne thinks quite right and was very glad to see, Lord
Melbourne had little hope of seeing your Majesty again, and
therefore ventured to take advantage of having ordered his
carriage at half-past twelve and of its having come at the time
that it was ordered. It was a very brilliant and very beautiful
and a very gay ball.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is very sorry to be obliged to express his
fear that your Majesty will prove more in the right than he was
about the duration of Parliament. There will be much debate
in the Committee upon the details of the Income Tax, and the
discussions upon the Tariff of duties, which affects so many
interests, are likely to be very long indeed. There is one good
thing in the House of Lords, and that is that it never much
delays or obstructs public business....</p>

<p class="ind">As Lord Melbourne drove down the Park on Saturday evening
last to dine with his sister, he could see clearly into your
Majesty's room, so as to be able to distinguish the pictures,
tables, etc., the candles being lighted and the curtains not
drawn. Your Majesty was just setting off for the Opera.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen encloses the Prince's letter to Sir Robert Peel,
containing his acceptance of the Guards. At the same time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.394" id="pagei.394"></a>[page&nbsp;394]</span>
both the Prince and Queen feel much regret at the Prince's
leaving the 11th, which is, if possible, enhanced by seeing the
Regiment out to-day, which is in beautiful order. It was,
besides, the Regiment which escorted the Prince from Dover
to Canterbury on his arrival in England in February '40.
The Queen fears, indeed knows, that Lord Cardigan will
be deeply mortified at the Prince's leaving the Regiment, and
that it will have the effect of appearing like another slight
to him; therefore, the Queen much wishes that at some
fit opportunity<sup>29</sup> a mark of favour should be bestowed upon
him....</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen hopes Sir Robert will think of this.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and acknowledges with many thanks your Majesty's letter of
the 24th inst., which he received yesterday morning. Lord
Melbourne learns with the greatest satisfaction that Lady
Lyttelton has undertaken the important and interesting charge,
for which she is so well fitted. Lord Melbourne is most sincerely
of opinion that no other person so well qualified could have
been selected. Lord Melbourne will keep the matter strictly
secret; he has not yet mentioned it to any one, nor has he heard
it mentioned by any other person, which, as it must be known
to some, rather surprises him. Unreserved approbation cannot
be expected for anything, but when it is known, Lord Melbourne
anticipates that it will meet with as general an assent as could
be anticipated for a choice in which all the community will
take, and indeed have, so deep an interest.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Brocket Hall</span>, <i>15th May 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He is very sorry indeed, and entreats your Majesty's pardon
for his great omission on Monday evening. He was never told
that he was to pass before your Majesty at the beginning; at
the same time he admits that it was a blundering piece of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.395" id="pagei.395"></a>[page&nbsp;395]</span>
stupidity not to find this out of himself. After this he never
saw the glimmer of a chance of being able to get near to your
Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne wonders much who could have whispered
to your Majesty that he felt or expressed anything but the most
unqualified admiration of the ball, which was the most magnificent
and beautiful spectacle that he ever beheld. Lord Melbourne
also believes it to be very popular, for the reasons which
your Majesty mentions.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty having generally chosen handsome and attractive
girls for the Maids of Honour, which is very right, must
expect to lose them in this way. Lord Melbourne is very glad
of the marriage. Lord Emlyn<sup>30</sup> always seemed to him a very
pleasing young man, and well calculated to make a woman
happy.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne felt quite sure that there had been a mistake
about Ben Stanley, which was the reason that he mentioned his
name. He is sorry that he has made a fool of himself by writing.
Having had so much to do with invitations during the
two last years, he was not altogether unnaturally mortified to
find himself not invited there.<sup>31</sup> Stanley is not a man to whom
Lord Melbourne is very partial, but we must give every one his
due. Lord Melbourne always discourages to the utmost of his
power the notion of any one's having a right or claim to be
asked, which notion, however, has a strong possession of the
minds of people in general.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is come down here again, being determined
to see this spring thoroughly and completely. His feelings
are like those, so beautifully described by Schiller, of Max
Piccolomini,<sup>32</sup> when, after a youth passed entirely in war, he for
the first time sees a country which has enjoyed the blessings
of peace. The Germans seem to Lord Melbourne generally
to prefer Goethe to Schiller, a decision which surprises
him, although he feels that he has no right to dictate to
a people, of whose language he does not understand a word,
their judgment upon their own authors. But the one,
Schiller, seems to him to be all truth, clearness, nature and
beauty; the other, principally mysticism, obscurity, and
unintelligibility.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne intends to return on Wednesday, and will
have the honour and pleasure of waiting upon your Majesty on
Thursday.</p>

give any legitimate ground of complaint to any other artist on

<p class="ind">The Queen is quite vexed at having been quite unable to
write to Lord Melbourne sooner, but we have been so occupied
that she could not. She was so vexed too to have not had her
head turned the other way when she met him yesterday, but
she was looking at the Prince, her Uncle, and Cousins riding,
and only turned to see Lord Melbourne's groom whom she
instantly recognised, but too late, alas! The Queen spent a
very merry, happy birthday at dear old Claremont, and we
finished by dancing in the gallery. She was grieved Lord
Melbourne could not be there.</p>

<p class="ind">We have got our dear Uncle Mensdorff<sup>33</sup> and his four sons
here, which is a great happiness to us. Dear Uncle (who Lord
Melbourne is aware is a <i>most</i> distinguished officer) is a delightful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.397" id="pagei.397"></a>[page&nbsp;397]</span>
and amiable old man, and the sons are all so nice and amiable
and kind and good; Lord Melbourne remembers seeing Alexander
here in 1839, and that the Queen was very partial to him.
The two eldest and the youngest&mdash;Hugo, Alphonse, and Arthur&mdash;are
all amiable, though none near so good-looking, but so very
well brought up and so unassuming. The second is very clever.
And it is quite beautiful to see the love the father has for his
sons, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>&mdash;and the affection the four brothers have
for one another; this is so rarely seen that it does one's heart
good to witness it. The Queen has appointed the Duchess of
Norfolk in Lady Lyttelton's place, and intends appointing
Lady Canning in Lady Dalhousie's, who has resigned from
ill-health.</p>

<p class="ind">Lady Lyttelton <i>is</i> established here in her new office, and does

of what happened yesterday evening, and to tell you that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.398" id="pagei.398"></a>[page&nbsp;398]</span>
are <i>saines et sauves</i>. On returning from the chapel on Sunday,
Albert was observing how civil the people were, and then
suddenly turned to me and said it appeared to him as though
a man had held out a pistol to the carriage, and that it had
hung fire; accordingly, when we came home he mentioned it
to Colonel Arbuthnot, who was only to tell it to Sir J. Graham
and Sir Robert Peel, and have the police instructed, and <i>nobody
else</i>. No one, however, who was with us, such as footmen, etc.,
had seen anything at all. Albert began to doubt what he
believed he had seen. Well, yesterday morning (Monday) a
lad came to Murray<sup>34</sup> (who of course knew nothing) and said
that he saw a man in the crowd as we came home from church,
present a pistol to the carriage, which, however, did not go off,
and heard the man say, "Fool that I was not to fire!" The
man then vanished, and this boy followed another man (an old
man) up St James's Street who repeated twice, "How very
extraordinary!" but instead of saying anything to the police,
asked the boy for his direction and disappeared. The boy
accordingly was sent to Sir Robert Peel, and (doubtful as it all
still was) every precaution was taken, still keeping the thing
completely secret, not a soul in the house knowing a word, and
accordingly after some consultation, as <i>nothing</i> could be done,
we drove out&mdash;many police then in plain clothes being distributed
in and about the parks, and the two Equerries riding so
close on each side that they must have been hit, if anybody had;
still the feeling of looking out for such a man was not <i>des plus
agr&eacute;ables</i>; however, we drove through the parks, up to Hampstead,
and back again. All was so quiet that we almost thought
of nothing,&mdash;when, as we drove down Constitution Hill, very
fast, we heard the report of a pistol, but not at all loud, so that
had we not been on the alert we should hardly have taken notice
of it. We saw the man seized by a policeman <i>next to whom
he was standing when he</i> fired, but we did not stop. Colonel
Arbuthnot and two others saw him take aim, but we only <i>heard</i>
the report (looking both the other way). We felt both very
glad that our drive had had the effect of having the man seized.
Whether it was loaded or not we cannot yet tell, but we are
again full of gratitude to Providence for invariably <i>protecting</i>
us! The feeling of horror is very great in the public, and great
affection is shown us. The man was yesterday examined<span class="rightnote">JOHN FRANCIS</span>
at the Home Office, is called John Francis, is a cabinet-maker,
and son of a machine-maker of Covent Garden Theatre, is
good-looking (they say). I have never seen him at all close,
but Arbuthnot gave the description of him from what he saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.399" id="pagei.399"></a>[page&nbsp;399]</span>
on Sunday, which exactly answered. Only twenty or twenty-one
years old, and <i>not</i> the <i>least</i> mad&mdash;but very cunning. The
boy identified him this morning, amongst many others. Everything
is to be kept secret <i>this</i> time, which is very right, and
altogether I think it is being well done. Every further particular
you shall hear. I was really not at all frightened, and
feel <i>very</i> proud at dear Uncle Mensdorff calling me "<i>sehr
muthig</i>," which I shall ever remember with peculiar pride,
coming from so distinguished an officer as he is! Thank God,
my Angel is also well! but he says that had the man fired on
Sunday, he must have been hit in the head! God is merciful;

He was much shocked at learning, which he did not do until
six o'clock yesterday evening, the event which took place on
Monday. After what took place on Sunday, it must have
been a trial to your Majesty's nerves, and still more to those
of the Prince, to go out on Monday; but it appears to Lord
Melbourne that your Majesty judged quite correctly in doing
so. Lord Melbourne hardly knows what to say of this repeated
attempt. It is a depravity and a malice as unintelligible as it

of your Majesty's subjects, and the gratitude is universal and
fervent for your Majesty's safety.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne had ridden over in the morning to visit
Lord and Lady Uxbridge in their rural retirement, and upon
his return to Brocket Hall, about six o'clock, found the morning
newspaper with the accounts of what had happened. If they
had sent him down a messenger on Monday night, which it
would have been better to have done, he would have been
yesterday in his place in the House of Lords.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne found Uxbridge enveloped in parcels and
boxes, which he was busy unpacking, Lady Uxbridge reclining
by the stream under the shade of a plane-tree, and the two
young ladies somewhat pensive. The place looked beautiful,
but Lord Melbourne fears that all its beauty will not be a
compensation to them for London at this time of the year.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir James Graham, with humble duty to your Majesty,
submits a copy of the Answer to the Address; and an alteration
has been made in the Answer which Sir James Graham
hopes may render it conformable to the tender and generous
feelings which your Majesty has deigned to express with
reference to the Prince.</p>

<p class="ind">The two Houses of Parliament followed the exact precedent
which has been established in Oxford's case; and although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.401" id="pagei.401"></a>[page&nbsp;401]</span>
the life of the Prince, so dear to your Majesty, is highly valued
by all your loving subjects, yet the crime of treason attaches
only to an attack on the sacred person of your Majesty; and
the expressions used by Parliament with reference to these
atrocious crimes, when directed against the Sovereign, are
necessarily inapplicable to any other person, and could not
be used with propriety. Hence the omission in the former
case of all allusion to the Prince; and the silence of Parliament
on the present occasion is to be ascribed to the same cause&mdash;not
to any cold indifference, which the general feeling of attachment
to the Prince entirely forbids.</p>

Sale and his admirable garrison.<sup>36</sup></p>

<p class="ind">The circumstances attending his glorious success, and the
consequences likely to result from it, are amongst the most
important of this hurtful war.</p>

<p class="ind">They are described in Sir Robert Sale's Report, as published
in the <i>Bombay Gazette</i>, a copy of which is most humbly submitted
to your Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">The despatches further bring the gratifying intelligence that
General Pollock had forced the Khyber Pass, and, defeating
the enemy on every point, had surmounted the chief obstacles
of that dangerous defile.<sup>37</sup></p>

<p class="ind">The relief of the brave men under Sir Robert Sale, to which
their own gallantry and their late victory have so mainly contributed,
may now be regarded as certain from the success of
General Pollock's advance.</p>

<p class="ind">It is with regret that Lord Fitzgerald has to add that the
citadel of Ghuznee has surrendered on the faith of a capitulation,
perhaps already violated, and that General England, who
had marched with a convoy of treasure, and other supplies for
the Army at Candahar, had been forced to retrace his steps
and had arrived at Quetta.</p>

<p class="ind">At the same time, however, General Nott had dispersed considerable
assemblages of rebel tribes, whom he had defeated
with loss, while an attack made during his absence on the city
of Candahar had been effectually repulsed by that portion of
his force which had been left for its defence.</p>

<p class="ind">The Governor-General having proceeded in person to the
North-Western Provinces of Bengal, had issued at Benares
General Orders congratulating the Army on the return of
victory to its ranks, and on the fresh lustre thus added to your
Majesty's Arms.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Fitzgerald and Vesci</span>.</p>



<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 36: Sir R. Sale, who with his column had thrown himself into Jellalabad on 13th
November 1841, and had heard Brydon's narrative, made a <i>sortie</i> on 7th April,
and secured a great victory over Akbar Khan, whose force outnumbered Sale's by
five to one.</p>

<p class="footnote1">Footnote 37: General Pollock, whom Auckland had selected for the command, and who found everything
in confusion on the frontier, swept the Khyber Pass of the enemy, and joined Sale.
The insurrection had spread to Candahar, where General (afterwards Sir William) Nott
was in command with a force of 10,000 men. He heard of Macnaghten's murder on 31st
January, and, like Sale, refused to follow the order received (under coercion, as he believed)
from Elphinstone to return to India. On the contrary, he ordered all Afghans
to leave Candahar, marched out himself and attacked and dispersed the enemy, 12,000
strong; while a flank movement made by the enemy on the city was repulsed with great
loss. General (afterwards Sir Richard) England started from Quetta with reinforcements,
but met with a reverse at Haikalzai; meanwhile also Colonel Palmer had had to make
terms at Ghuznee, and had to encounter treachery. Nott, who was badly in want of
money and ammunition for the troops, sent imperative orders to General England to
reinforce him, which he did early in May.

<span class="rightnote">DEBATE ON THE INCOME TAX</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">South Street</span>, <i>10th June 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He has thought it better not to interrupt your Majesty with
letters during the bustle of the last week, but he cannot omit
to express to your Majesty how much he was struck with the
letter of the 2nd inst. which he received, and how entirely he
concurs in the justice and propriety of your Majesty's feelings
and observations. Let us hope that we shall have no more
of these horrid attempts, which are generated by the wild
notions of the time, and by the expectation, extravagant and
unfounded, so industriously inculcated into the public mind,
of advantages to be derived from change and confusion;
Lord Melbourne anxiously hopes that the painful impressions
which such events are calculated to produce upon your
Majesty's mind, and which they necessarily must produce, will
pass away and that nothing will happen to renew and revive
them.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is happy to hear from Normanby that
everything passed off well and successfully at Windsor and at
Ascot. The last is always rather a doubtful and disagreeable
ordeal to pass through.</p>

<p class="ind">We should have got through the debate upon the Income
Tax this evening in the House of Lords, if Lansdowne had not
unfortunately this morning had an access of gout in the hand,
which prevented him from attending, and obliged the debate to
be deferred. Lord Melbourne hopes that the resolution which
Lansdowne is to move<sup>38</sup> is put in such a shape as to vindicate
our course, and at the same time not to condemn that which
has been adopted overmuch, nor to pledge us for the future....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne earnestly hopes that your Majesty is well
and not too much affected by the heat of this weather, which
does not suit Lord Melbourne very well. In conjunction with
a large dinner which we had at the Reform Club in honour of
the Duke of Sussex, it has given Lord Melbourne a good deal
of headache and indisposition. The Duke was in very good
humour, and much pleased with the dinner, but he was by no
means well or strong.</p>


<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 38: This Resolution was in favour of altering the Corn, Sugar, and Timber Duties, in
preference to imposing an Income Tax. It was negatived by 112 to 52.

<span class="rightnote">THE INCOME TAX BILL</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">South Street</span>, <i>19th June 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and offers many thanks for the letter, which he received
yesterday evening. Lord Melbourne is very glad to hear that
your Majesty has enjoyed in the society of your near and dear
relations so much happiness, which, like all other things, must
have its portion of alloy in their departure. Lord Melbourne
was much pleased with the short conversation which he had
with Count Mensdorff at Stafford House, and it is highly
interesting to see at this distance of time a man who has been
engaged in affairs so important and of so awful and melancholy
a character. Your Majesty is surely right in terming your
cousins young men; if the health and constitution be good,
thirty-six is a young man, twenty-nine and thirty-two very
young men, and twenty-five quite a boy. The weather has
been very hot but very fine. The rain was so much required
that Lord Melbourne cannot lament its coming, but he also
regrets the hot suns which it has banished.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.405" id="pagei.405"></a>[page&nbsp;405]</span>

<p class="ind">The course which had been taken upon the Income Tax in
the House of Commons,<sup>40</sup> contrary to Lord Melbourne's wish
and opinion, rendered it impossible for Lord Melbourne
directly to support the Bill in the House of Lords without
offending and separating himself from the whole body of those
who supported the last Government.</p>

<p class="ind">He therefore acquiesced in the resolution, which was moved
by Lord Lansdowne, and which did not oppose the measure,
but declared that it might have been avoided if the course
which we had proposed had been taken. In the debate Lord
Melbourne argued as strongly as he could in favour of the
tax, and ended by declaring that if it was imposed, he could
not pledge himself for the future against maintaining and even
extending it. Lord Melbourne is anxious to make this explanation
of his conduct to your Majesty, and hopes therefore
that your Majesty will forgive his writing thus much upon
this subject. Lord Melbourne very much lamented that the
business did not terminate as amiably as it began, and that a
contest should have been got into respecting the third reading
of the Bill; but considering that the measure had passed by
accident through its first stages without any debate, and
that there were Lords who were still desirous of speaking
upon it, it was imprudent of the Ministers not at once to
give another day for that purpose, especially as they were
sure to be compelled to do so by repeated motions of
adjournment.</p>

<p class="ind">The feelings which your Majesty expresses upon the conviction
of this man<sup>41</sup> are natural, and such as must arise in
your Majesty's bosom; but Lord Melbourne knows very well
that your Majesty will at once see the necessity of not yielding
to your own feelings, and of leaving the issue entirely in the
hands of your advisers.</p>

<p class="ind">Without any reference to personal or particular circumstances,
without adverting to your Majesty's age, sex, qualities
mental or personal, without attending to any sentiments of
attachment or affection which may be felt for your Majesty's
person, it must be remembered that your Majesty's life is,
from the position which you occupy and the office which you
fill, the most important life in these realms; it is also too clear
that it is the most exposed life in the country, the life the most
obnoxious<sup>42</sup> to danger; and therefore it is a duty to throw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.406" id="pagei.406"></a>[page&nbsp;406]</span>
around it every protection which the law and the execution
of the law can afford.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne was sure that your Majesty, being fond of
speed, would be delighted with the railway. Lord Melbourne
hopes that your Majesty was not much affected by the heat,
which he feared that you would be.</p>

<p class="ind">Has your Majesty read the last volume of Madame D'Arblay's
(Miss Burney) Diary, which contains the account of her service
in the family of George III.?<sup>43</sup> It is a curious [work], gives a
curious account of the <i>int&eacute;rieur</i>, and shows the King and
Queen and the Princesses in a very amiable light.</p>

commission of such acts. The only observation that can be made

determination and the same long and ferocious preparation
which characterised in France the conduct of Fieschi and

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My beloved Victoria</span>,&mdash;You have surely already heard of
the heavy visitation God has sent us. My beloved brother was
unexpectedly taken away from us before yesterday evening.
Before yesterday morning he went to Neuilly to take leave of
my parents, previous to his departure for St Omer. The
horses ran away: he had the unfortunate idea to jump out from
his barouche&mdash;a thing I cannot understand, as he had on all
occasions an uncommon presence of mind&mdash;fell upon his head,
and expired a few hours afterwards, in presence of my too

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Claremont</span>, <i>16th July 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen is anxious to draw Sir Robert Peel's attention
to a circumstance which she has already some months ago
mentioned to him: this is relative to Sir Edward Disbrowe.<sup>48</sup>
The Queen knows that Sir Robert Peel shares her opinion as
to Sir Edward Disbrowe's abilities not being of the first order,
but this is not the only thing; what she chiefly complains of
is his decided unfairness towards Belgium, which she thinks
has always shown itself, and again most strongly in his last
despatches. The King of the Belgians has never dropped a
word on the subject, but the Queen really feels it her duty by
her Uncle to state this frankly to Sir Robert Peel, and to say
that she thinks it highly important that Sir Edward Disbrowe
should be removed to some other Mission. Of course she
wishes that this should be done quietly, but she thinks that with
a man like the present King of the Netherlands, who is continually
intriguing in Belgium and making her Uncle's position
very painful, it is of the utmost importance that our Minister

most decidedly is not. Could not Sir T. Cartwright be sent
there, and Sir Edward Disbrowe go to Stockholm? The Queen
merely suggests this; but, of course, as long as the man sent to
the Hague is sensible and <i>fair</i>, it is indifferent to her who goes
there....</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Claremont</span>, <i>17th July 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen had intended to have written to Lord Melbourne
some time ago to have thanked him for his kind letter of the
5th, but she was so occupied, first of all with the arrival of our
brother and sister, with our removal here, and lastly by the
dreadful misfortune at Paris, which has completely overpowered
her, and made her quite ill&mdash;that it prevented her
from doing so. The Queen is sure that Lord Melbourne will
have warmly shared the universal horror and regret at the
untimely and fearfully sudden end of so amiable and distinguished
a Prince as poor Chartres (as we all called the Duke of
Orleans) was! The loss to France, and indeed Europe, is very
great; but to the Royal Family, dearest Louise (who all doted
on him), and above all to poor unfortunate H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, who adored
him (and he was a most devoted husband to her), and to his
two poor little boys of four and one years old&mdash;he is an irreparable
loss. The Queen has heard from none yet, but has
seen a letter from Guizot, who was a witness of the <i>last scene</i>,
which is quite truly reported in the papers; he says it was
fearful&mdash;the poor Duke lying and dying on a mattress on the
floor surrounded by his parents and sisters, kneeling and praying
around their dearly beloved Child! Alas! poor H&eacute;l&egrave;ne had
not even that comfort!</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen is very glad that the Bill for the better security
of her person has passed so quickly and in so gratifying a
manner through both Houses.</p>

<p class="ind">We are here since yesterday week, enjoying the fine weather,
and great quiet and peace; but the news from Paris have
damped our spirits.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen is charmed with her new sister,<sup>49</sup> who is a most
amiable, sensible, and gentle creature, and without being really
handsome, very pretty and pleasing.</p>

<p class="ind">We return to town to-morrow and the Queen hopes soon to
see Lord Melbourne. We intend going to Windsor to settle, on
Saturday.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen trusts Lord Melbourne is quite well.</p>

<span class="rightnote">LEIGH HUNT</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">South Street</span>, <i>22nd July 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty, and ventures to
transmit the copy of Mr Leigh Hunt's poem, which he mentioned
to your Majesty in his last letter. Lord Melbourne
also sends the letter which Mr Leigh Hunt has taken the liberty
of addressing to your Majesty, as well as that which he has
addressed to Lord Melbourne. Lord Melbourne will inform
Mr Hunt that he has done this, and it is not at all required that
any further notice should be taken.<sup>50</sup></p>

<p class="ind">It is a very gay and lively work, and has in it some wit and
fun.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne had great pleasure yesterday in seeing your
Majesty well and in good spirits.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">32 Edwardes Square, Kensington</span>, <i>15th July 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My Lord</span>,&mdash;I was once speaking to Mr Fonblanque<sup>51</sup> of my
unwillingness to trouble your Lordship, when Prime Minister,
with a request to lay my tragedy of the <i>Legend of Florence</i><sup>52</sup>
before Her Majesty; and he said that he was sure your good-nature
would not have been displeased with it. This is the
reason why I now venture to ask whether a similar kindness
might be shown the accompanying little poem, supposing no
etiquette to stand in the way of it. I have no Tory channels of
communication with the Palace, nor wish to seek any; neither
can I trespass upon any friendships of Her Majesty's, unless
they can find my excuse in some previous knowledge of me.
On the other hand, I have no fear of being supposed by your
Lordship to approach one who is no longer Premier with less
respect than when he was in power. I would even venture to
say, if the mode of testifying it were not so poor a one, that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.413" id="pagei.413"></a>[page&nbsp;413]</span>
is in a double spirit of respectfulness the application is made.
Should it be of a nature calculated to give your Lordship any
perplexity, I can only blush for having been the occasion of it,
and beg it may be laid to the account of an ignorance which
lives very much out of the world. The same reason will plead
my excuse for not knowing whether a letter to Her Majesty
ought, or ought not, to accompany the book; and for begging
your Lordship, after its perusal, to suppress it or otherwise
accordingly, in case you can oblige me in the other part of my
request. Your Lordship will perceive that the Address prefixed
to the poem, not having ventured to ask Her Majesty's
permission, does not presume to call itself a dedication; neither
does it leave the public under any erroneous impression whatsoever
as to the nature of its intentions: and on this account
I not only expect, of course, no acknowledgment of its receipt
on the part of any one about Her Majesty's person, but shall
be more than content to understand by your Lordship's own
silence that my book has reached its destination, and therefore
not been considered altogether unworthy of it.</p>

<p class="ind">The bookseller tells me that it is no longer "the mode" for
authors to present their volumes <i>bound</i>; but in regard to books
intended to go to Court, he is not quite so certain; and I find
it so difficult to disassociate the idea of dress from any such
proceeding, that I trust my inexperience in this respect also
will procure me whatever pardon it may require.</p>

<p class="ind">I have the honour to be, my Lord, your Lordship's ever
grateful and faithful Servant,</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE AFFLICTED FAMILY</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Neuilly</span>, <i>21st July 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My beloved Victoria</span>,&mdash;I was unable to thank you the
other day for your kind and feeling letter of the 14th, although
I was greatly touched by it, and I trust you will have excused
me. I thank you to-day very sincerely for both your letters,
and for the share and sympathy you and dear Albert take in
our <i>great misfortune</i>. I know it is very heartfelt, and we are
all very grateful for it. Victoire and my poor mother have
already given you news from the unfortunate H&eacute;l&egrave;ne. She
has sustained and outlived the first shock and shows wonderful
courage. She is even well in health, and much better and
stronger in all ways than I had expected. She takes very much
upon herself on account of the poor children, to prevent that
any melancholy or painful feeling should be connected for them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.414" id="pagei.414"></a>[page&nbsp;414]</span>
with the remembrance of their beloved and unfortunate father.
My parents show great fortitude and resignation, but their
hearts are for ever broke. They are only sustained by their
feeling of duty. My poor mother bears up for my father, and
my father bears up to fulfil his duties of father and of king.
Their health is, thank God! good, and my father retains all
his strength of mind and quickness of judgment; but they are
both grown old in looks, and their hairs are turned quite white.</p>

<p class="ind">The first days, my poor father could do nothing but sob,
and it was really heartbreaking to see him. He begins now
to have more command upon his grief, and the presence of your
uncle, whom he dearly loves, seems to do him good. The poor
children are well and <i>merry</i> and seem unconscious of their
dreadful loss. From time to time only they jump round us
as if looking for protection. The contrast of their gaiety with
their horrid misfortune is very painful. Paris is looking
remarkably well and strong. Robert<sup>53</sup> is much grown, extremely
quick and lively, and begins to speak. The remainder
of the family is, as you may easily imagine, in the <i>deepest
affliction</i>. Nemours especially is quite broken down with grief.
Chartres was <i>more</i> than a <i>brother</i> to him, as he was <i>more</i>
than a
<i>second father</i> to us all. He was the <i>head</i> and the <i>heart</i> and
<i>soul</i>
of the whole family. We all looked up to him, and we found
him on all occasions. A <i>better</i>, or even <i>such</i> a brother was
never seen; our loss is as great as irreparable; but God's will
be done! He had surely His motives in sending on my unfortunate
parents the horrid affliction in their old days, and in
removing from us the being who seemed the <i>most necessary</i> to
the hope and happiness of all; we must submit to His decrees,
hard as they are; but it is impossible not to regret that my
poor brother has not at least found the death of a soldier,
which he had always wished for, instead of such a useless,
horrid, and miserable one! It seems, for no one saw him fall,
that he did not jump, as we had thought at first, but that he
was thrown from the barouche, while standing; and I like it
in some measure better so, as God's will is still more manifest
in this way. It is equally manifest in <i>all</i> the circumstances
attending the catastrophe. My poor brother was not even
to have come to Neuilly. He had taken leave of my parents
the day before, and would not have gone again if my unfortunate
mother had not asked him, and if my parents, who were
to go to Paris, had not delayed their departure....</p>

<p class="ind">I thank you again and again, my beloved Victoria, for all
your interest and sympathy. I was sure you would think of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.415" id="pagei.415"></a>[page&nbsp;415]</span>
us and of me: you know how much I loved my brother. I
little expected to outlive him, as I had done my beloved
Mary;<sup>54</sup> but once more, <i>God's will be done</i>. I remain now and
ever, yours most devotedly,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Louise.</span></p>

<p class="ind">I perceive I forgot mentioning Ernest. Pray thank him for
his sympathy also. He knows what a brother is, and may feel
for us! We expect on Saturday poor Joinville. My father
will have thus his four remaining sons round him for the opening
of the Session, which takes place on the 26th, and at which
he must preside in person. It is a hard duty for him.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel, with his humble duty to your Majesty,
begs leave to acquaint your Majesty that last night was occupied
in the House of Commons with another debate on the Corn
Laws, again impeding any progress with the Government
business. The debate was entirely confined to those members
who act in concert with the Anti-Corn Law League.<sup>55</sup> It continued
until twelve, when Mr Cobden, the Member for Stockport,
moved an adjournment of the House, on the ground that
none of your Majesty's servants had taken a part in the
debate....</p>

<p class="ind">Several members of the Opposition voted with the Government,
and declared that they would not be parties to such
vexatious proceedings.</p>

<p class="ind">A division on the main question&mdash;a Committee to enquire
into the state of the country with a view to the Repeal of the
Corn Laws&mdash;then took place.</p>

<p class="ind">The motion was negatived by a majority of 156 to 64&mdash;92.
The House did not adjourn until three this morning.</p>


<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 55: The Anti-Corn Law League was rapidly gaining importance, and fiscal policy occupied
a great part of the session of 1842. Peel was already reducing import duties on articles
other than corn. Cobden had been elected at Stockport, for the first time, in 1841.

<span class="rightnote">FURTHER PARTICULARS OF ACCIDENT</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Neuilly</span>, <i>22nd July 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Victoria</span>,&mdash;I was anxious to write to you on
the 18th, but I was so overpowered with all that surrounded
me that I could really not. Yesterday I received your dear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.416" id="pagei.416"></a>[page&nbsp;416]</span>
letter of the 19th, and I will answer it, so as to give you a clear
view of the sad case. On the 12th, Tuesday, Chartres had
taken leave, as he meant to go to St Omer, the 13th; however,
in the family the Queen and others said he ought to come once
more to see them. The King had ordered his carriage to go
to town on the 13th, to a Council; Chartres meant to have
called shortly after ten.</p>

<p class="ind">It is necessary to tell you all this, as it shows how strangely
circumstances turned fatally. Chartres did not want to return
once more to Neuilly, and the King, if exact, might see him
once more in town. Chartres, however, instead of coming
early, set off after eleven; his Off. d'Ordonnance, M. Bertin
de Veaux, his <i>valet de chambre</i>, a German, Holder, begged him
not to go quite alone in that small phaeton through Paris, as
he was in uniform, but all this did not avail; he insisted to go
in the phaeton and to go <i>alone</i>. He set out later than he
expected, and if the King had set out <i>exactly</i> as he had named,
the parents and the son would probably have met on the rising
avenue of the Champs Elysees, towards the Barri&egrave;re de l'&Eacute;toile
and Arc de Triomphe. However, the King delayed his departure
and the son set off. At the place where from the great
avenue one turns off towards Neuilly, the horses, which were
not even young horses, as I am told that he has had them some
years, moved by that stupid longing to get to Neuilly, where
they knew their stables, got rather above the postillion, and
ran <i>quasi</i> away. Chartres got up and asked the postillion if
he could hold his horses no longer; the boy called out "Non,
Monseigneur"; he had looked back when he said this, and
saw his master for the last time <i>standing</i> in the phaeton. People
at some distance saw him come out of his carriage and describe
a sort of semicircle falling down. Nobody knows exactly if he
jumped out of the carriage, or if he lost his position and fell out.
I am inclined to think that, trusting to his lightness and agility,
he wanted to jump out, forgetting the impulse which a quick-going
carriage gives, as there were marks on his knees as if he
had first fallen that way. The principal blow was, however, on
the head, the skull being entirely fractured. He was taken up
senseless, that is to say confused, but not fainting, and carried
into a small inn. At first his appearance, sitting in a chair, was
so little altered that people thought it was nothing of any consequence.</p>

<p class="ind">He <i>knew</i> no one, and only spoke a few incoherent words in
German. The accident happened about a quarter before twelve,
and at four he was no more.</p>

<p class="ind">I refer for some other details to Albert. Poor Louise looks
like a shadow, and only her great devotion for me supports her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.417" id="pagei.417"></a>[page&nbsp;417]</span>
It may serve as a lesson how fragile all human affairs are. Poor
Chartres, it seems, with the prospect of these camps and
altogether, was <i>never in better spirits</i>. But I must end. Ever,
my dearest Victoria, your devoted Uncle,</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He thanks your Majesty much for the letter of the 4th. It can
hardly be expected that the grief of the French family will, as
yet, much diminish, but Lord Melbourne hopes that they are
somewhat more composed. He has heard this morning that
Lord and Lady Beauvale were at Boulogne on Saturday; they
would probably cross yesterday, and will be in London to-day.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.419" id="pagei.419"></a>[page&nbsp;419]</span>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne understands that Lord Beauvale had an interview
of three hours with the King of the French. Charles
Howard was married this morning, and Lord Melbourne is
going to meet Lord and Lady Carlisle and the rest of the family
at Baron Parke's<sup>58</sup> at dinner. Lord Melbourne thinks that
Lord Prudhoe's marriage<sup>59</sup> was to be expected.<sup>60</sup> Upon looking
at the Peerage, he is only fifty years old, and fifty is young
enough to marry anybody. The only fault of fifty is that it
advances too rapidly on to sixty, which, on the other hand, is
too old to marry anybody. It is Lord Melbourne's opinion that
if a man does marry either at fifty or sixty, he had much better
take a young girl than a woman of more age and experience.
Youth is more malleable, more gentle, and has often more
respect and compassion for infirmity than middle-age.</p>

<span class="rightnote">RESIGNATION OF LORD HILL</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Hardwicke Grange</span>,<sup>61</sup> <i>9th August 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Hill presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and
craves your Majesty's gracious permission to lay before your
Majesty his resignation of the Command of your Majesty's
Army.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Hill deeply regrets the necessity of taking a step which
will deprive him of a charge that has been so long committed
to his hands, and for his continuance in which he is indebted
to your Majesty's grace and favour; but he has again suffered
much from the illness under which he laboured in the early
part of the year, and his health has in consequence become so
indifferent as to render him unequal to the adequate discharge
of the various important duties of his command, which therefore
he feels he could not retain with due regard to the interests
of your Majesty's Service.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Hill had flattered himself that he should have been able
to have laid his application for retirement before your Majesty
himself, and personally to have expressed to your Majesty his
deep and lasting sense of your Majesty's gracious kindness to
him on all occasions. Having, however, left London by the
advice of his medical attendants, and being too unwell to undertake
a second journey, Lord Hill avails himself of this mode of
assuring your Majesty of his unabated zeal for the Service, of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.420" id="pagei.420"></a>[page&nbsp;420]</span>
dutiful devotion to your Majesty's person, and of the pain and
sorrow with which he relinquishes an appointment that afforded
him the honour and advantage of executing your Majesty's
commands, and receiving many gracious proofs of your Majesty's
support and confidence.</p>

<span class="rightnote">APPOINTMENT OF COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF</span>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and begs leave to acquaint your Majesty that he received at a
late hour last night the accompanying letter to your Majesty
from Lord Hill. From the one which accompanied it, addressed
to Sir Robert Peel, he has reason to believe that it conveys
to your Majesty the wish of Lord Hill to be relieved, on the
ground of ill-health and increasing infirmities, from the Command
of your Majesty's Forces.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel would humbly submit for your Majesty's
consideration whether it might not be a deserved mark of your
Majesty's approbation to confer upon Lord Hill the rank of
Viscount, with remainder to his nephew Sir Rowland Hill,<sup>62</sup> who
will succeed Lord Hill in the Barony. Lord Beresford<sup>63</sup> and
Lord Combermere<sup>64</sup> have the rank of Viscounts, and perhaps
the long, faithful services of Lord Hill as Commander-in-Chief
may appear to your Majesty to entitle him to equal distinction
in the Peerage.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel has reason to believe that when Lord Hill's
retirement shall be known there will be many competitors for
the office of Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir George Murray,<sup>65</sup> Sir Edward Paget,<sup>66</sup> Lord Londonderry,<sup>67</sup>
Lord Combermere, and perhaps Lord Beresford, will severally
urge their pretensions.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel humbly submits to your Majesty that should
the Duke of Wellington be willing to undertake the duties of
this important trust, no claims could stand in competition with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.421" id="pagei.421"></a>[page&nbsp;421]</span>
his, and no selection from the candidates whom he has named
would be satisfactory to the Army or public in general.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel would therefore humbly recommend to your
Majesty that the offer of this appointment should be made to
the Duke of Wellington, with the signification of a wish on the
part of your Majesty (should your Majesty be pleased to
approve of the arrangement), that His Grace should continue
a member of the Cabinet, and the organ of the Government, as
at present, in the House of Lords.</p>

and is much concerned to learn that Lord Hill's health is so
indifferent that he thinks it is his duty to resign the important
office which he has so long and so honourably held. The Queen
can only reluctantly give her consent to this determination, as
she regrets to lose Lord Hill's services at the head of her Army.
She cannot, however, miss this opportunity of expressing to
Lord Hill her entire approbation of his conduct throughout the
time he served her. The Prince begs to have his kind regards
sent to Lord Hill.</p>

<span class="rightnote">RIOTS IN MANCHESTER</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Cabinet Room, Downing Street</span>, <i>13th August 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and is sorry to be under the necessity of troubling your Majesty
so suddenly, but he is sure your Majesty will excuse him for
making any proposal to your Majesty which the public service
may render requisite.<sup>68</sup></p>

<p class="ind">The accounts received this morning from Manchester with
regard to the state of the country in that neighbourhood are
very unsatisfactory, and they are confirmed by the personal
testimony of magistrates who have arrived in London for the
purpose of making representations to your Majesty's servants
on the subject.</p>

<p class="ind">A Cabinet has just been held, and it is proposed to send a
battalion of Guards by the railway this evening. The 16th of
August (Tuesday next) is the anniversary of a conflict which
took place in Manchester in the year 1819<sup>69</sup> between the Yeomanry
Cavalry and the populace, and it is feared that there
may be a great assemblage of persons riotously disposed on
that day.</p>

<p class="ind">Under these circumstances it appears desirable to your
Majesty's confidential advisers that a proclamation should be
immediately issued, warning all persons against attendance
on tumultuous meetings, and against all acts calculated to
disturb the public peace. It is necessary that a Council should
be held for the issue of this proclamation, and important that
it should arrive in Manchester on Monday.</p>

<p class="ind">These considerations have prevented Sir Robert Peel from
giving previous notice to your Majesty, and having your
Majesty's sanction for the holding of a Council. On account
of the urgency of the case, he has requested a sufficient number
of Privy Councillors to repair to Windsor this evening, in
order that should your Majesty be graciously pleased to hold
a Council, the proclamation may be forthwith issued. The
members of the Privy Council will be in attendance about
half-past six o'clock, as Sir Robert Peel has considered that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.423" id="pagei.423"></a>[page&nbsp;423]</span>
from that time to half-past seven will probably be the least
inconvenient to your Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">He writes this immediately after the breaking up of the
Cabinet.</p>


<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 68: The disturbances of this month, which originated in a strike for wages in Lancashire,
were inflamed by agitators, and rapidly spread through Cheshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire,
and Yorkshire, eventually extending to the populous parts of Scotland and Wales.
Several conflicts took place between the populace and the military, and there was much
loss of life and property, as well as aggravated distress.</p>

<p class="footnote1">Footnote 69: On 16th August 1819, a great popular demonstration in favour of Parliamentary
Reform, presided over by Henry Hunt, the Radical, had taken place in St Peter's Fields,
Manchester. A riot ensued, and the Yeomanry charged the populace, with some loss
of life. The affair was afterwards known as the Peterloo massacre.

<span class="rightnote">CHARTIST DISTURBANCES</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Whitehall</span>, <i>15th August 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir James Graham, with humble duty, begs to lay before
your Majesty the enclosed letter from Major-General Sir
William Warre<sup>70</sup> in command of the Northern District.</p>

<p class="ind">From this report it is evident that a strong and salutary
moral impression had been produced by the arrival of a reinforcement
of 1,400 men in the disturbed district in the short
time of six-and-thirty hours after the first requisition for
assistance had been sent from Manchester; and the General
has now at his disposal a force quite adequate to cope with the
vast assemblage of people who are expected to meet to-morrow
at Manchester.</p>

<p class="ind">Some symptoms of this disposition forcibly to suspend
labour have appeared in the West Riding of Yorkshire; but
on the whole the accounts, both from Scotland and the disturbed
district, which have been received this morning, may
be considered favourable. The railroad communications as
yet are uninterrupted; no collision has taken place between
the troops and the multitude, except at Preston;<sup>71</sup> and Sir
James Graham is willing to hope that this insurrectionary
movement may be suppressed without recourse to extreme
measures. Every precaution, however, has been taken, and
arrangements are made for augmenting the force under the
command of Sir William Warre, if it should become necessary.</p>

<p class="ind">The character of these riots has assumed more decidedly
a political aspect. It is no longer a strike for higher wages,
but the Delegates, who direct the movement, avow that
labour shall not be resumed until the people's Charter be
granted.<sup>72</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Sir James Graham will hasten to-morrow to inform your
Majesty of the accounts which he may receive.</p>

(<i>Thursday morning</i>.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and begs leave to acquaint your Majesty that he returned to
London last night.</p>

<p class="ind">He has this morning gone through all the letters received
from the country, with Sir James Graham, by
whom the details of the information will be forwarded to
your Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">It appears to Sir Robert Peel that the general tenor of the
reports is <i>satisfactory</i>. From Manchester, from Wigan, from
Preston, the reports are very good.</p>

<p class="ind">The movement is not one caused by distress. The demand
for employment has increased, and the price of provisions&mdash;and
particularly of potatoes, bread, and bacon&mdash;has rapidly
fallen within the last fortnight or three weeks.</p>

<p class="ind">People of property and the Magistrates (notwithstanding
their political dissensions) are now acting in harmony, and
with more energy.</p>

<p class="ind">Orders have been sent to apprehend the Delegates assembled
in Manchester, <i>the very moment</i> that the law will warrant their
apprehension, and Sir Robert Peel should not be surprised to
hear of their committal to Lancaster Castle in the course of
to-day.</p>

<p class="ind">Every vigilance will be exerted with reference to <i>Cooper</i><sup>73</sup>
(whom your Majesty names) and all other itinerant agitators.</p>

<p class="ind">As might be naturally expected, the movements and disorderly
spirit spreading from the centre (Manchester) are
appearing in remote points; but when peace and confidence
are thoroughly restored at Manchester, the example will quickly
tell in the circumjacent districts.</p>

from Scotland are favourable.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He is going down to-day to Brocket Hall with Lord and Lady
Beauvale. Lord and Lady Palmerston are coming down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.425" id="pagei.425"></a>[page&nbsp;425]</span>
to-morrow, and Lord and Lady Cowper will probably come
over from Panshanger.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty read extremely well in the House of Lords on
Friday last.<sup>74</sup> Lord Melbourne can judge better of this from
the body of the House than he could when he stood close to
your Majesty. Nothing can be more clear and distinct, and
at the same time more natural and free from effort. Perhaps
if your Majesty could read a tone louder it would be as well.
Charles Buller, who was amongst the House of Commons, told
Lord Melbourne that, where he stood, the voice, although well
heard, sounded somewhat weak. But this should not be
attempted unless it can be done with perfect ease. Nothing
injures reading so much as the attempt to push the organ
beyond its natural powers.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne hopes that these tumults in the manufacturing
districts are subsiding, but he cannot conceal from
your Majesty that he views them with great alarm&mdash;much
greater than he generally thinks it prudent to express. He
fears that they may last in the form of strike, and turn out
much longer than is looked for, as they did in 1832 and 1833.</p>

<p class="ind">There is a great mass of discontented feeling in the country
arising from the actual state of society. It arises from the
distress and destitution which will fall at times upon a great
manufacturing population, and from the wild and extravagant
opinions which are naturally generated in an advanced and
speculative state of society.</p>

<p class="ind">This discontent has been aggravated and fermented by the
language of every party in the state. Lord Melbourne can
exempt no party from this blame, nor hardly any individual
except himself. The Tories and Conservatives (not the
Leaders, but the larger portion of the party) have done what
they could to inflame the public mind upon that most inflammable
topic of the Poor Laws. The <i>Times</i> newspaper has
been the most forward in this. The Whigs and Radicals have
done what they could in the same direction upon the Corn
Laws. Mr Attwood<sup>75</sup> and another set have worked the
question of the Currency, and the whole career of Mr O'Connell
in Ireland has been too manifest to be mistaken. It is no
wonder if working in this manner altogether they have at last
succeeded in driving the country into this which is certainly
very near, if not actually a rebellion.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne earnestly hopes that your Majesty and the
Prince, the Prince, and Princess are all well.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir James Graham, with humble duty, is happily enabled
to state to your Majesty that the accounts from the disturbed
districts received this morning are more satisfactory.</p>

<p class="ind">In Lancashire a disposition to resume work has been partially
evinced; and at Preston, where the most vigorous measures
were taken in the first instance, there has hardly been a cessation
of employment.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir James Graham encloses a letter from the Chief Constable
of the County of Lancashire detailing a successful resistance
to a fresh attempt on the part of a mob to enter Preston; and
he sends also a report from the Mayor of Manchester and from
Mr Forster, the Stipendiary Magistrate. Decisive measures
will be adopted for the immediate apprehension of the Delegates,
not only at Manchester, but in every other quarter where legal
evidence can be obtained which will justify their arrest. The
law, which clearly sanctions resistance to the entry of these
mobs into cities, is now understood by the local authorities.
A bolder and firmer spirit is rising among all classes possessing
property in defence of their rights against these bands of
plunderers, who are the enemies both of law and of property.
The prisoners taken in the commission of treasonable felonies
are numerous; warrants are issued against others whose
persons are known: the supremacy of the law will be promptly
vindicated, and Sir James Graham entertains the confident
hope that order will be soon restored.</p>

<p class="ind">In the Potteries a signal example was made by a handful of
your Majesty's troops opposed to a riotous multitude which
had burnt houses and spread devastation, and Sir James
Graham encloses a letter from Captain Powys giving a description
of the occurrence. The effect of this example has
been that yesterday throughout this district no rioting took
place.</p>

will send to Manchester to-night an experienced law officer,
for the purpose of pursuing the investigation on the spot.</p>

o'clock, and moved through the city to Bethnal Green. Sir

<p class="ind">Lord Stanley, with his humble duty, submits for your

from the Governor of the Cape of Good Hope, detailing
the unfortunate result of an attack made by a small party of
your Majesty's troops upon the camp of the insurgent Boers at
Natal; and also the copy of a despatch which Lord Stanley
has sent in consequence to Sir George Napier,<sup>76</sup> which, he trusts,
may meet your Majesty's approbation. Lord Stanley would
have submitted the draft for your Majesty's approval previous

it off by a fast-sailing private ship which sailed this morning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.428" id="pagei.428"></a>[page&nbsp;428]</span>
the intelligence having only been received yesterday. The
instructions sent to Sir George Napier, on the 10th of April,
but not received when this unfortunate affair took place, were
in substance not to attempt the subjugation of these people
by direct force, but to warn them that their titles to the land
which they occupy would not be recognised by your Majesty,
that they would have no title to claim protection from the
aggression of the neighbouring tribes, to interdict communication
between them and the settled parts of the Colony, and to
prevent any intercourse by sea with foreign or British traders.
The unfortunate event which has now occurred will render
it necessary to take steps, as Sir George Napier has already
done, for vindicating the power of your Majesty's Arms; but
when that shall have been effected, Lord Stanley would still
hope that a considerable number of these misguided men may
be induced to return to their allegiance, and to the settled
parts of your Majesty's dominions, and he feels confident that
in such an event he will be fulfilling your Majesty's wishes in
directing that they may be treated with all possible lenity.</p>

travelling about and seeing so much that is <i>totally</i> new, it is

<p class="ind">Albert has told you already how successfully everything had
gone off hitherto, and how much pleased we were with Edinburgh,
which is an unique town in its way. We left Dalkeith
on Monday, and lunched at Dupplin, Lord Kinnoul's, a pretty
place with quite a new house, and which poor Lord Kinnoul
displayed so well as to fall head over heels down a steep bank,
and was proceeding down another, if Albert had not caught
him; I did not see it, but Albert and I have nearly died with
laughing at the <i>relation</i> of it. From Dalkeith we went through
Perth (which is <i>most</i> beautifully situated on the Tay) to Scone
Palace,<sup>78</sup> Lord Mansfield's, where we slept; fine but rather
gloomy. Yesterday morning (Tuesday) we left Scone and
lunched at Dunkeld, the beginning of the Highlands, in a tent;
<i>all</i> the Highlanders in their fine dress, being encamped there,
and with their old shields and swords, looked very romantic;
they were chiefly Lord Glenlyon's<sup>79</sup> men. <i>He</i>, poor man! is
suddenly become <i>totally</i> blind, and it was very melancholy to
see him do the <i>honours</i>, <i>not</i> seeing <i>anything</i>. The situation
of Dunkeld, down in a valley surrounded by wooded hills, is very,
very pretty. From thence we proceeded to this enchanting
and princely place; the whole drive here was beautiful. All
Lord Breadalbane's<sup>80</sup> Highlanders, with himself at their head,
and a battalion of the 92nd Highlanders, were drawn up in front
of the House. In the evening the grounds were splendidly
illuminated, and bonfires burning on the hills; and a number
of Highlanders danced reels by torchlight, to the bagpipes,
which was very wild and pretty....</p>

Melbourne, but we have seen and done so much, it has been
impossible. Everything has gone off so well at Edinburgh,
Perth, and elsewhere. This is a princely and most beautiful
place, and we have been entertained by Lord Breadalbane in
a magnificent way. The Highland Volunteers, two hundred in
number (without the officers), keeping guard, are encamped in
the park; the whole place was twice splendidly illuminated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.430" id="pagei.430"></a>[page&nbsp;430]</span>
and the sport he gave the Prince out shooting was on the
largest scale.</p>

<p class="ind">The Highlands and the mountains are too beautiful, and we

finish this letter at Drummond Castle,<sup>81</sup> as we leave this in half
an hour.</p>

<p class="ind"><i>Drummond Castle, 11th</i>.&mdash;We arrived here yesterday evening
at seven, having had a most beautiful journey. We went
with Lord Breadalbane up the Loch Tay (by water) to Ochmore<sup>82</sup>
(I don't know <i>how</i> it is written), a cottage belonging to
Lord Breadalbane, close to Killin. The morning was very fine,
and the view indescribably beautiful; the mountains so high,
and so wooded close to Killin. It is impossible to say how
kind and attentive Lord Breadalbane and poor Lady Breadalbane
(who is so wretchedly delicate) were to us. We were so
sorry to go away, and might perhaps have managed to stay two
days longer at Taymouth, were we not fearful of delaying our
sea voyage back too much. However, we mean to visit him
for longer another time; the Highlands are so beautiful, and
so new to <i>me</i>, that we are most anxious to return there again.</p>

<p class="ind">The journey from Killin to Comrie was <i>most</i> beautiful, and
through such wild scenery&mdash;Glen Ogle, which of course Lord
Melbourne knows&mdash;and then along Loch Ern. This house is
quite a cottage, but the situation is fine, and the garden very
beautiful. We leave this on Tuesday for Dalkeith<sup>83</sup> where we
sleep, and re-embark the next day for <i>England</i>. We greatly
admire the extreme beauty of Edinburgh; the situation as
well as the town is most striking; and the Prince, who has
seen so much, says it is the finest town he ever saw. Scone
Palace (where we slept on Tuesday night) is fine, but gloomy;
Perth is beautiful.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen hopes Lord Melbourne is very well. The Prince
begs to be remembered to him.</p>

of our arrival here. Dearest Louise will have told you what
I wrote to her. We had a speedy and prosperous voyage home
of forty-eight hours, on board a fine large and very fast steamer,
the <i>Trident</i>, belonging to the General Steam Navigation Company.
We found our dear little Victoria so grown and so improved,
and speaking so plain, and become so independent;
I think really few children are as forward as she is. She is
quite a dear little companion. The Baby is sadly backward,
but also grown, and very strong. I am so distressed about
dearest Louise's still coughing, but she tells me it is decreasing.
Only pray let her give way to her grief; much crying, even if it
makes her cough for the moment, can do her no real harm, but
stifling and swallowing <i>grief</i> (which she <i>cannot</i> repress) gnaws
at the very roots of life and undermines health. Ostend and
sea-baths would, I should think, do her good.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.432" id="pagei.432"></a>[page&nbsp;432]</span>
to state to your Majesty that the <i>first</i> act of Sir Robert
Peel on his return from Scotland was to write to Lord Haddington<sup>89</sup>
and strongly urge upon the Admiralty the necessity of
providing a steam yacht for your Majesty's accommodation.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel trusts that your Majesty may entirely depend

resolve upon in the early part of next summer, in a steam
vessel belonging to your Majesty, and suitable in every respect
for your Majesty's accommodation.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel has had a personal communication with Sir
John Barrow,<sup>90</sup> one of the Secretaries to the Admiralty, this
morning, upon the subject, and Sir Robert Peel has written by
this post to Sir George Cockburn,<sup>91</sup> who is out of town.</p>

<p class="ind">He finds that the Admiralty is now building a large vessel
to be worked by steam power, applied by means of a revolving
screw instead of paddles. It may be doubtful whether the
same degree of velocity can be attained by means of the screw,
particularly in a very large vessel. Of this a full trial will be
made.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir John Barrow assures Sir Robert Peel that he has been on
board a steam-boat moved by the screw, and that the working
of the engine is scarcely perceptible; that there is none of the
tremulous motion which accompanies the beats of the paddles,
and that it will be possible to apply an apparatus by means of
which the smoke can be consumed, and the disagreeable smell
in great measure prevented.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen, with his most humble duty, lays before your
Majesty a letter which he has received from Mr Aston, respecting
the marriage of the Queen of Spain, and which, after
what has already passed, may perhaps cause your Majesty
some surprise.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen is humbly of opinion that the language
hitherto employed by your Majesty's Government upon this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.433" id="pagei.433"></a>[page&nbsp;433]</span>
subject ought not to undergo any change, and that it ought to
be treated entirely as a Spanish question.</p>

<p class="ind">Great Britain would naturally regard a marriage with a son
of the King of the French as injurious to Spain and menacing to
Europe, but would probably not feel it necessary to give such
an opinion respecting any other alliance. While this might be
plainly stated, and the Spanish Government exhorted to act
according to their own independent view of the real interests of
the country and of the Queen, Lord Aberdeen would humbly
propose that the Regent should be explicitly informed by Mr
Aston that he must not expect to receive any assistance from
your Majesty's Government in promoting a marriage with a
Prince of the Netherlands.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen believes that the difficulties in the way of
such an alliance will be found to be very great, and especially
that the religion of the Prince will present an obstacle which in
Spain must be nearly insurmountable.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and has to acknowledge your Majesty's letter of the 25th inst.,
which he had the honour and pleasure of receiving here on the
27th. Lord Melbourne is well aware how much your Majesty's
time must have been occupied by the number of visitors at the
Castle. We are much rejoiced here that your Majesty saw the
Prince and Princess Liechtenstein.<sup>92</sup> The latter is a great
favourite of Lady Beauvale's, to whom she was always very
kind, and who describes her exactly as your Majesty does, as
being very "amiable and unassuming," and though one of the
first, if not the first lady at Vienna, as not at all partaking of the
insolence and hauteur which is by some ascribed to the society
of that capital. As a beauty, she is perhaps upon too large
a scale, except for those who admire women of all shapes and
sizes; but her eyes and brow are very fine, and there is a very
peculiarly soft and radiant expression about them. Lord
Melbourne had heard of his Sovereignty, but understands that
his territory is extremely limited. His possessions as a subject
of Austria are worth a good deal more than his German
principality.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne greatly congratulates your Majesty upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.434" id="pagei.434"></a>[page&nbsp;434]</span>
happy progress and termination of the expedition to Scotland.
He is very glad of three things&mdash;that your Majesty returned
by sea, in the steamer, and that the passage was a good one....</p>

<p class="ind">The country is indeed most interesting, full of real picturesque
beauty and of historical and poetical associations and
recollections. There is nothing to detract from it, except
the very high opinion that the Scotch themselves entertain of
it. Edinburgh is magnificent&mdash;situation, buildings, and all&mdash;but
the boasting of the articles in the newspapers respecting it
almost inclined one to deny its superiority. It is also, as your
Majesty says, most striking to contemplate in the Clans the
remains of feudal times and institutions. It is quite as well,
however, particularly for Monarchy, that they are but remains,
and that no more of them have been left.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne thanks your Majesty much for your kind
enquiries after his health. He thinks that he is getting better
and stronger than he has been, and has a notion of trying a
little shooting in October.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is very glad to hear that your Majesty is
reading with the Prince. Hallam's work<sup>94</sup> certainly requires
much consideration and much explanation, but it is a fair,
solid, impartial work, formed upon much thought and much
reading. St Simon's<sup>95</sup> is an excellent work; he has some
prejudices, but was a good honest man, and his book is full of
useful information. If your Majesty wishes for a book relating
to what passed from one hundred to two hundred years
ago, Lord Melbourne would strongly recommend the Private
Memoirs of the Lord Chancellor Clarendon (Edward Hyde),
not the great work, <i>The History of the Rebellion</i>, though that
is well worth reading, but the <i>Memoirs</i>, and Bishop Burnet's
History of his own time. The reigns of Charles II., James II.,
and the Revolution are very curious in the latter. During
Queen Anne's reign the Bishop was not so much consulted, and
his work is therefore not so interesting. If your Majesty
wishes to turn your attention to more recent events, Professor
Smyth's<sup>96</sup> lectures upon Modern History, and particularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.436" id="pagei.436"></a>[page&nbsp;436]</span>
upon the French Revolution, seem to Lord Melbourne sound,
fair, and comprehensive. Lord Mahon's<sup>97</sup> is also a good work,
and gives a good account of the reigns of George I. and George
II. He has been thought by some in his last volume to have
given too favourable a character of the Chevalier, Charles
Edward Stuart.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is much touched by what your Majesty says
of the Princess Royal, and the delight and comfort which your
Majesty finds in her, as well as by the whole picture which
your Majesty draws of your domestic happiness. When your
Majesty refers to what passed three years ago, your Majesty
may be assured that it is with no small pleasure that Lord
Melbourne recalls any share which he may have had in that
transaction, and congratulates himself as well as your Majesty
and the Prince upon results which have been so fortunate both
for yourselves and for the country. Lord Melbourne ventures
to hope that your Majesty will convey these feelings to the
Prince, together with the assurance of his respectful remembrance.</p>

kind dear letter of yesterday with its enclosures, which I have
just received. Your opinion respecting George of Hanover's<sup>98</sup>
marriage is quite my own, and I regret that the King does not
seem to be inclined to settle it and fix a day for the celebration
of it. I do not know his reasons against it, for I have not
heard from him for a long, long time. I am so sorry to find
that the accounts of his health are so indifferent, and fear he
is not careful enough.</p>

<p class="ind">I am happy to hear that you thought the Cambridge visit
went off well, and that the affianced<sup>99</sup> looked and seemed
happy. I hope it will always be the same, and that the
marriage will not be delayed too long. I always had imagined
that the Duke of Cambridge was rich and would give a fortune
to his daughters, but I have lately heard that it is not the case.
I do not know what is the usual marriage portion of an English
Princess given by the country. In Germany those portions
are called <i>die Prinzessin Teuer</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">We received 25,000 Fl. each when we married, and 10,000 Fl.
for our <i>trousseaux</i> each.</p>

<p class="ind">If the young couple are to live in future with the Grand
Duke they will not want any Plate, but if they are to have a
separate <i>m&eacute;nage</i>, then they will want it. I shall find it out by
and by. I wonder that the Duchess likes to part with her fine
sapphires. I thought the turquoises had been intended for
Augusta.</p>

<p class="ind">I wish you could see the Convent to which I went the other
day. The nuns belong to the Order of the Cistercian <i>Trappists</i>.
They are not allowed to speak amongst themselves&mdash;what
a relief my visit must have been to them!&mdash;and they
neither eat meat, nor butter, nor eggs&mdash;nothing but milk,
vegetables and rice. They look healthy, and there were
several young rather pretty ones amongst them. One, the
best-looking of them all, Sister Marie Josepha, took me
affectionately by the hand and said, "I hope the air agrees
with you here and that you feel better?" and then she added,
"Come again&mdash;will you, before you leave this country again?"
She told me that she was born in Ireland and had a German
grandfather. She seemed to be the favourite amongst them
all, for when I bought of their works and asked them to make

up my bill, they called Marie Josepha to summon it up, and she
said to me, "Do not stay for that; we will send you your
things with the bill." Two hours after my visit to them I
received my things, with a wreath of flowers besides as their
gift to me; on the paper attached to it was written, "To the
Queen-Dowager, from the Reverend Mother and her Community."</p>

<p class="ind">This old Reverend Mother, the Abbess, was very infirm, and
could not get up from her chair, but she spoke very politely and
ladylike to me in French. She has been forty years in her
present <i>situation</i>, and comes from Bretagne. The chaplain of
the Convent is also an old Frenchman, and there are several
other French nuns amongst them&mdash;one who had been condemned
to be guillotined in the Revolution, and was set at
liberty just at the moment the execution was to have taken
place. I should like to know whether these good nuns
resumed again at once their silence when I left them, or
whether they were permitted to talk over the events of that
day.... Your most affectionately devoted Aunt,</p>

<p class="indright"><i>1st November 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">... Many thanks for your most kind and amiable letter of
the 28th, which I received yesterday. The prospect of the
possibility of dearest Louise's spending some time with us <i>quite
enchants</i> us, and I hope and trust that you will carry your plan
into execution. Our plans, which we only settled last night,
are as follows:&mdash;the scarlet fever is on the decrease at Brighton,
but not sufficiently so to justify our going there immediately;
so we therefore intend going to Walmer with the children, but a
very reduced suite (as the house is considerably smaller than
Claremont), on the 10th, and to stay there till the 22nd inst.,
when we shall go to Brighton and remain there till the 13th of
December. Now if dearest Louise would meet us there then,
and perhaps come back with us here for a little while <i>then</i>?
Windsor is <i>beautiful</i> in December.</p>

<p class="ind">The news of Lord Melbourne, I am thankful to say, are

but his first seizure was very alarming.<sup>100</sup> I shall not fail to

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and begs leave to acquaint your Majesty that he brought under
the consideration of your Majesty's servants the questions relating
to certain of the Crown Jewels, and the claim upon them
preferred by the King of Hanover.<sup>105</sup></p>

<p class="ind">In the course of the discussion it appeared to Sir Robert Peel
that there were still some points in respect to this very embarrassing
question which required the grave consideration of
legal authorities, and that it would not be prudent to take any
step, even that of submitting the case to arbitration, without
the highest legal authority.</p>

<p class="ind">The submission to arbitration might avoid the evil (and a
very great one it would be) of public controversy in a Court of
Justice, and of public examination of members of the Royal
Family on a matter partly of a domestic nature; but on the
other hand, great care must be taken that by submitting the
case to the award of arbitrators, even should they be nominated
altogether by your Majesty, we do not relinquish any <i>fair</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.440" id="pagei.440"></a>[page&nbsp;440]</span>
advantage for the Crown of England which would have
accompanied an appeal to the regularly constituted tribunals
of the country.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty's Solicitor-General was employed as Counsel
for the King of Hanover, and it has been thought therefore
advisable to make the reference to the Attorney-General and
to the Queen's Advocate.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel has attempted to bring every questionable
point in the case submitted to them under the consideration of
your Majesty's law advisers, and when their report shall be
received he will not fail to lay it before your Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel had a personal interview a few days since
with His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, on the subject
of a public provision for the Princess Augusta on the
occasion of her marriage.<sup>106</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel thought it advisable to enquire from the
Duke of Cambridge, as the impression of the public (of which
His Royal Highness is quite aware) is that he has a considerable
fortune of his own, independently of his annual allowance
from Parliament.</p>
<span class="rightnote">PROVISION FOR PRINCESS AUGUSTA</span>
<p class="ind">The Duke of Cambridge seemed entirely to share the impressions
of Sir Robert Peel that in the present state of the
country, and of the public revenue, great caution is requisite
in respect to the proposal of a grant of public money as a
marriage portion to the Princess Augusta, and that it would be
important that in any proposal to be made there should be a
general acquiescence on the part of the House of Commons.</p>

<p class="ind">As the marriage is not to take place for some time it appears
to Sir Robert Peel that it might be advisable to postpone a
decision, at least in respect to the particular amount of any
provision to be made, till a period nearer to the meeting of
Parliament.</p>

<p class="ind">A public intimation, or the public notoriety long beforehand
of the intention to propose a grant of public money
might, in the present temper of the times, interpose additional
obstacles in the way of it.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel proposes to return to Drayton Manor for a
short time, and to leave London to-morrow morning.</p>


<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 105: The King claimed them on the ground that part belonged to the Crown of Hanover,
and part had been bequeathed to him by Queen Charlotte. The matter was referred
to a Commission consisting of Lords Lyndhurst and Langdale, and Chief Justice Tindal.
The two former were divided in opinion, and the Chief Justice died before the award
was made. It was not till 1857 that a final decision, substantially in favour of Hanover,
was given.</p>

<span class="rightnote">SUCCESSES IN CHINA</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Downing Street</span>, <i>23rd November 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Stanley, with his humble duty, has the honour of submitting
to your Majesty an original despatch from Lieutenant-General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.441" id="pagei.441"></a>[page&nbsp;441]</span>
Sir Hugh Gough, received this morning, detailing the
triumphant successes which had crowned the exertions of your
Majesty's Naval and Military forces in China,<sup>107</sup> and of the completely
satisfactory result in the execution of a Treaty of Peace
with the Emperor of China, upon terms highly honourable to
your Majesty and advantageous to this country.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Stanley learns from Lord Fitzgerald that he is also
forwarding to your Majesty, by this messenger, the details
which the same mail has brought of the complete and triumphant
issue of the campaign in Afghanistan.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Stanley trusts that he may be permitted to offer to
your Majesty his humble congratulations upon intelligence so
glorious to British Arms, and so important to British interests.
It is difficult to estimate the moral effect which these victories
may produce, not on Asia merely, but throughout Europe also.
At the same moment your Majesty has brought to a triumphant
issue two gigantic operations, one in the centre of Asia, the
other in the heart of the hitherto unapproachable Chinese
Empire. In the former, past disasters have been retrieved;
a signal victory has been achieved on the very spot memorable
for former failure and massacre; the honour of the British
Arms has been signally vindicated; the interests of humanity
have been consulted by the rescue of the whole of the prisoners;
and, after a series of victories, the Governor-General of India
is free, without discredit, to enter upon measures of internal
improvement, and having established the supremacy of British
power, to carry on henceforth a more pacific policy.</p>

<p class="ind">In China a termination has been put to the effusion of blood
by the signature of a treaty which has placed your Majesty's
dominions on a footing never recognised in favour of any
foreign Power&mdash;a footing of perfect equality with the Chinese
Empire; which has obtained large indemnity for the past, and
ample security for the future, and which has opened to British
enterprise the commerce of China to an extent which it is almost
impossible to anticipate. It may interest your Majesty
to hear that already enquiries are made in the City for superintendents
of ships to trade to <i>Ningpo direct</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Stanley has taken upon himself to give orders in your
Majesty's name for firing the Park and Tower guns in honour
of these glorious successes. A <i>Gazette</i> extraordinary will be
published to-morrow, the voluminous nature of the despatches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.442" id="pagei.442"></a>[page&nbsp;442]</span>
rendering it necessary to take some time lest an important
despatch should be omitted.</p>

<p class="ind">All which is humbly submitted by your Majesty's most
dutiful Servant and Subject,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Stanley</span>.</p>


<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 107: Chapoo was taken by Sir Hugh Gough in May: in June the squadron, under Admiral
William Parker, entered the waters of the Yang-tze, captured Chin-kiang-fu, and were
about to attack Nanking, when the treaty was concluded, embracing among other things
a payment by the Chinese of 21,000,000 dollars, the cession of Hong Kong, and the opening
of the ports of Canton, Amoy, Foochow, Ningpo, and Shanghai.

begs leave most humbly to inform your Majesty that the
despatches received from the Governor-General of India announce
the results of a series of most brilliant exploits by the
armies under Major-General Nott and General Pollock in
Afghanistan.</p>

<p class="ind">Each of those armies has achieved a glorious victory over
superior numbers of the enemy.</p>

<p class="ind">The city of Ghuznee has been captured, and its formidable
fortress utterly razed and destroyed.</p>

<p class="ind">The survivors of the British garrison, which had capitulated
in the spring of the year, and who had been reduced to slavery,
have been redeemed from bondage.</p>

<p class="ind">The splendid victory of General Pollock has been obtained
over the army commanded by Akbar Khan in person, on the
very spot where the greatest disaster had befallen the British
Army on their retreat, and where the last gun had been lost.</p>

<p class="ind">On the 16th of September, General Pollock entered Cabul
with his victorious troops and planted the Colours of your
Majesty in the Bala Hissar, on the spot most conspicuous from
the city.</p>

<p class="ind">An extract from a letter from General Pollock to Lord Ellenborough,
dated at Cabul the 21st of September, gives the most
gratifying intelligence that <i>all</i> the British prisoners, with the
exception of Captain Bygrave, have been rescued from Akbar
Khan, and were expected in the British camp on the 22nd of
September.</p>

<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 108: The mail, which informed Ministers of the Chinese success, also brought the news
of the capture of Cabul. General Nott (see <i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#pagei.402" style="font-weight: normal;">402</a>) had by the end of July completed
his preparations, and marched upon Ghuznee, having arranged to meet Pollock at Cabul,
and having transferred the Scinde command to General England. Nott was before
Ghuznee on 5th September, but at daylight on the 6th found it evacuated; the citadel
was destroyed by him and the Gates of Somnauth removed, as directed by Lord Ellenborough.
Pollock, to whose discretion Ellenborough had entrusted the policy of advancing
on Cabul, secured supplies at Gundamuck, and on his advance met the enemy
in a strong position in the Jugdulluck Pass and dispersed them; then at Tezeen, on
12th September, he was attacked by Akbar Khan with 20,000 men. The Pass was
forced, and the Afghans retired to the Haft Kotal, where they were utterly defeated, close
to the scene of Elphinstone's disaster. Nott arrived at Cabul on the day after Pollock.

Donna Maria's stay at Paris. My constant advice has been to
look exclusively to the closest alliance with England, and
Ferdinand is now <i>well aware</i> of it; but you know that the
Liberal party tried to even harm him by representing him as a

<p class="ind">Lord Ellenborough, with his most humble duty to your
Majesty, humbly offers to your Majesty his congratulation on
the entire success which has attended the operations of the
Fleet and Army under your Majesty's direction in the Yantze-Kiang,<sup>110</sup>
and submits to your Majesty the general order which,
on the receipt of the intelligence of that success and of the peace
concluded with the Emperor of China upon the terms dictated
by your Majesty, he issued to the Army of India.</p>

<p class="ind">Your Majesty will have observed that in the letter of the
4th of July to Major-General Nott, that officer was instructed
to bring away the gates of the Temple of Somnauth, from the
tomb of Mahmood of Ghuznee, and the club of Mahmood also.</p>

<p class="ind">The club was no longer upon the tomb, and it seems to be
doubtful whether it was taken away by some person of Lord
Keane's Army in 1839, or by Shah Sooja, or whether it was
hidden in order to prevent its being taken away at that time.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.445" id="pagei.445"></a>[page&nbsp;445]</span>

<p class="ind">The gates of the Temple of Somnauth have been brought
away by Major-General Nott.</p>

<p class="ind">These gates were taken to Ghuznee by Sultan Mahmood in
the year 1024. The tradition of the Invasion of India by Sultan
Mahmood in that year, and of the carrying away of the gates
after the destruction of the Temple, is still current in every
part of India, and known to every one. So earnest is the desire
of the Hindoos and of all who are not Mussulmans to recover
the gates of the Temple, that when ten or twelve years ago
Runjeet Singh was making arrangements with Shah Sooja for
assisting him in the endeavour to recover his throne,<sup>111</sup> he wished
to make a stipulation that when Shah Sooja recovered his power
he should restore the gates to India, and Shah Sooja refused.</p>

the gates of the Temple will be restored.<sup>112</sup></p>

great distance are mostly fatal. The Queen joins in Sir Robert's
opinion, that before coming to a final arrangement it will be
most valuable to have Sir H. Pottinger's opinion upon your
present message, and thinks it much the best that Sir H. should

in the meantime be entrusted with the <i>extraordinary</i> full powers
for concluding any provisional arrangements, as she believes
that very great confidence may be placed in him. Lord Stanley's
suggestions strike the Queen as very judicious and calculated
to facilitate the future Government of Hong-Kong.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and with reference to enquiries made by your Majesty when
Sir Robert Peel was last at Windsor, on the subject of the
Scotch Church and the proceedings of the last General Assembly,
begs leave to acquaint your Majesty that the Moderator
of the Assembly has recently addressed a letter to Sir Robert
Peel, requiring an answer to the demands urged by the General
Assembly in a document entitled a Protest and Declaration of
Right.<sup>116</sup></p>

<p class="ind">The demands of the General Assembly amount to a reversal
by Law of the recent decisions of the Court of Session and of the
House of Lords, and to a repeal of the Act of Queen Anne, which
establishes the Right of Patronage in respect to Livings in the
Church of Scotland.</p>

<p class="ind">That Act by no means gives any such absolute right of appointment
to the Crown or other patrons of Livings, as exists
in England. It enables those legally entitled to the patronage
to present a clergyman to the Living, but the Church Courts
have the power, on valid objections being made and duly sustained
by the parishioners, to set aside the presentation of the
patron, and to require from him a new nomination.</p>

<p class="ind">The Church, however, requires the absolute repeal of the
Act of Anne.</p>

<p class="ind">An answer to the demands of the Church will now become
requisite.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.448" id="pagei.448"></a>[page&nbsp;448]</span>

<p class="ind">Sir James Graham has been in communication with the law
advisers of your Majesty in Scotland upon the legal questions
involved in this matter, and will shortly send for your Majesty's
consideration the draft of a proposed answer to the General
Assembly.<sup>117</sup></p>


<p class="footnote1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 116: The famous Auchterarder case had decided that, notwithstanding the vetoing by
the congregation of the nominee of the patron, the Presbytery must take him on trial
if qualified by life, learning, and doctrine,&mdash;in other words, that the Act of Anne, subjecting
the power of the Presbytery to the control of the law courts, was not superseded
by the Veto Act, a declaration made by the General Assembly. In the Strathbogie case,
a minister had been nominated to Marnock, and 261 out of 300 heads of families had
objected to him. The General Assembly having directed the Presbytery to reject him,
the civil court held that he must be taken on trial. Seven members of the Presbytery
obeyed the civil power, and the General Assembly, on the motion of Dr Chalmers, deposed
them and declared their parishes vacant.</p>

<p class="footnote1">Footnote 117: Sir James Graham's letter is printed in the Annual Register for 1843. A petition in
answer was drawn by the Assembly and presented to Parliament by Mr Fox Maule. After
the debate on it in the Commons, preparations were made throughout Scotland for the
secession of the non-intrusionists, as they were called, which event took place on 18th May
1843, when about 500 Ministers, headed by Chalmers, seceded from the Old Kirk, and
founded the Free Church.

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty,

which, with your Majesty's sanction, James Graham proposes
to write to the Moderator of the General Assembly of
the Church of Scotland.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel fears that there is too much ground for
the apprehensions expressed by your Majesty in respect to
future embarrassment arising out of the position of the Church
Question in Scotland.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel saw yesterday a letter addressed by Dr
Abercrombie,<sup>118</sup> the eminent physician in Edinburgh, to Sir
George Sinclair,<sup>119</sup> declaring his conviction that the Secession of
Ministers from their Livings would take place to <i>a very great
extent</i>&mdash;would comprise very many of the Ministers most distinguished
for learning and professional character, and would
meet with very general support among their congregations.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel has little doubt that a serious crisis in the
History of the Church of Scotland is at hand, and that the result
of it will be greatly to be lamented; but still he could not
advise your Majesty to seek to avert it by the acquiescence in
demands amounting to the abrogation of important civil rights
and to the establishment in Scotland of an ecclesiastical domination
independent of all control....</p>

<p class="ind">He is very confident that your Majesty will feel that in the
present state of the controversy with the Church of Scotland,
there is peculiar reason for taking the greatest care that every
minister presented to a Crown Living should be not only above
exception, but should, if possible, be pre-eminently distinguished
for his fitness for a pastoral charge.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Brocket Hall</span>, <i>30th December 1842</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He has been much delighted this morning by receiving your
Majesty's letter of the 28th. He was the more gratified, as he
had begun to be a little annoyed at being such a very long time
without hearing from your Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Mahon has sent Lord Melbourne his book.<sup>120</sup> Lord
Melbourne has not yet read it, but he has read the review of it
in the <i>Quarterly</i>, which seems to be a sort of abstract or abridgment
of the book. The effect of writing it in French has naturally
been to direct all attention and criticism from the merits
of the work to the faults of the French. People who have
read the work speak of it as entertaining, and the times are
curious and interesting. The characters engaged in them,
striking and remarkable. Lord Melbourne is very glad to hear
that Pottinger's conduct is so universally approved. He always
appeared to Lord Melbourne to be a man of great ability,
resolution and discretion, and Lord Melbourne much rejoices
that he has turned out so.</p>

<p class="ind">Hallam's opinions Lord Melbourne believes to be in general
sound, and such as have been held and approved by the most
able and constitutional statesmen in this country.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is much rejoiced to hear of the Princess and
the Prince of Wales, and also that your Majesty is pursuing
your studies quietly, cheerfully, and happily.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is very sensible of the interest which the
Baron takes in his health and which he warmly reciprocates.
There is no man whom he esteems more, nor of whose head and
heart he has a better opinion.</p>

<p class="ind">We expect here to-morrow the Duchess of Sutherland<sup>121</sup> and
Lady Elizabeth Gower,<sup>122</sup> who have been kind enough to propose
to pay Lord Melbourne a visit.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 5em;">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>

<h3 style="margin-top: -0.5em;">TO CHAPTER XII</h3>


<p><span class="sc">Repeated</span> debates took place during the year (1843) on the Corn
Laws, the agitation against them steadily growing, Mr Cobden
coming on one occasion into violent conflict with the Premier. The
events of the previous year in Afghanistan were also the subject of
constant discussion in Parliament. A movement of some importance
took place in Wales in opposition to the increasing number of toll-bars,
bands of rioters dressed in women's clothes and known as
"Rebecca and her daughters," demolishing the gates and committing
acts of greater or less violence. A verse in Genesis (xxiv. 60) fancifully
applied gave rise to this name and disguise.</p>

<p>In Scotland the system of private patronage in the Established
Kirk had become very unpopular, the Act of Anne in favour of the
nomination by lay patrons, and the control given to the Law Courts
over the revising action of the Presbytery being ultimately modified
by a declaration of the General Assembly known as the Veto Act.
But it was decided in what was called the Strathbogie case that the
veto was illusory, the disruption of the old Kirk followed, and on 18th
May Dr Chalmers and five hundred other ministers seceded from it in
order to form the Free Church.</p>

<p>In Ireland the agitation for Repeal was at its height. O'Connell,
supported by the <i>Nation</i> newspaper, founded a Repeal Association
in Dublin, and monster meetings were held on Sundays on some
conspicuous spot of free and historic associations to claim the
re-establishment of a Parliament on College Green. It was believed
that a quarter of a million people were present on one occasion,
and the Government, alarmed at the absolute power wielded by
O'Connell over these huge bodies of men, resolved to prohibit the
meetings, and somewhat tardily issued a Proclamation against that
announced for Clontarf on 8th October. O'Connell accordingly
disbanded the meeting, but his action did not please his more zealous
supporters, and his ascendency came to an end. The agitation
collapsed and the principal actors were arrested.</p>

<p>A military duel fought in the summer of this year, in which a
colonel in the Army was shot by his brother-in-law, made the code
of honour existing on the subject a burning question, the criminal
law of homicide being the same then as now. On Prince Albert's
suggestion, the question was taken up by the heads of the Army
and Navy, and the Articles of War were in the following year amended
so as to admit of an apology and a tender of redress.</p>

<p>The better feeling existing between this country and France
enabled the Queen and Prince to visit Louis Philippe at the Ch&acirc;teau
d'Eu.</p>

from this so very dear and comfortable old place, where you
will have heard from Louise that we arrived with our dear
Pussy on Thursday last. We are <i>all</i> so particularly well, including
Pussy, that we intend, to my great delight, to prolong
our stay till next Monday. This place has a peculiar charm
for us both, and to me it brings back recollections of the <i>happiest</i>
days of my otherwise <i>dull</i> childhood&mdash;where I experienced such
kindness from you, dearest Uncle, which has ever since continued.
It is true that my <i>last</i> stay here <i>before</i> I came to the
Throne, from November '36 to February '37, was a peculiarly
painful and disagreeable one, but somehow or other, I do <i>not</i>
think of those times, but only of all the former <i>so</i> happy ones.
Victoria plays with my old bricks, etc., and I think you would
be pleased to see this and to see her <i>running</i> and jumping in
the flower garden, as <i>old</i>&mdash;though I fear <i>still little</i>&mdash;<i>Victoria
of</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.452" id="pagei.452"></a>[page&nbsp;452]</span>
<i>former days</i> used to do. She is very well, and such an amusement
to us, that I can't bear to move without her; she is <i>so</i>
funny and speaks so well, and in French also, she knows almost
everything; she would therefore get on famously with Charlotte....</p>

<p class="ind">Might I ask you some questions about Joinville's match,<sup>1</sup>
which interests me much? First of all, <i>have</i> you heard of his
arrival at Rio? Secondly, if the Donna Francesca pleases, is
he empowered <i>at once to make the demand</i>, or must he write
home first? How nice it would be if the <i>two</i> marriages could
take place at <i>once</i>; but I suppose, under any circumstances,
that could <i>not</i> be....</p>

<p class="ind">Alexandrine is nearly quite recovered; she writes such
pretty, affectionate, kind letters, poor dear child, and is so
fond of Ernest. I must say I think <i>he</i> seems improved, as he
likes to live <i>quietly</i> with her, and speaks of her too with the

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and thanks your Majesty much for your letter of the 9th inst.
which he received yesterday. Every letter that he receives
from your Majesty brings back to his mind the recollection of
times, which, though they were clouded with much care and
anxiety, were still to Lord Melbourne a period of much happiness
and satisfaction....</p>

<p class="ind">Hallam has not written a History of the Church, but in all
his books there is necessarily much about the Church, and
much that is worthy of mention. A short History of the
Church is, Lord Melbourne fears, not to be found, the subject
is so large and so difficult that it cannot be treated shortly.
Dr Short<sup>2</sup> has written and published a clever, brief, and distinct
summary, but it relates principally to the Church of
England, and in order to be fully understood, requires to be
read by one who has already some acquaintance with the
subject.</p>

<p class="ind">The book which your Majesty remembers Lord Melbourne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.453" id="pagei.453"></a>[page&nbsp;453]</span>
reading is the production of Dr Waddington,<sup>3</sup> whom your
Majesty, under Lord Melbourne's recommendation, made Dean
of Durham, which dignity he now holds. It is a very good
book.</p>

<p class="ind">Adolphus's<sup>4</sup> History is by no means a bad book, and will
give your Majesty the facts of the beginning of the reign of
George III. well and accurately enough. The Duke of Sussex
once told Lord Melbourne that he had asked his father whether
Adolphus's account of the beginning of his reign was correct,
and that the King had replied that substantially it was so, but
that there were some mistakes, and that what had been done
by one person was often attributed to another. Adolphus's
History will receive some illustration from Horace Walpole's
letters of that period....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne thinks that he is really getting rid of the
gout, and gathering strength. He still has some doubt
whether he shall be able to go up for the meeting of Parliament.
Lord Melbourne begs to renew to your Majesty the
warm and respectful assurance of his gratitude and attachment.</p>

God that she is so well this time. Can you imagine her with

was here with us. How time flies rapidly. I own I was not a
little surprised to find that you are probably the godmother;
or is the little boy only to be named after you? I remember
well what you said to me when I was asked to be the godmother
of the first boy, "<i>that I could not accept it</i>," as I must not take
the responsibilities attached to a sponsor with a Roman
Catholic child. On that ground alone, and having learned
your opinion which sanctioned my own, I refused it then at
the risk of offending the dear parents. Now, after all that was
said on the subject, if <i>you have accepted</i> the offer of becoming

the duties which our Church imposes upon sponsors, having
refused what you accepted. I tell you fairly and openly that
it has vexed me, but of course I say this only to <i>yourself</i>,
dearest Victoria, and not to any one else, for it does not become
me to find fault with what you please to do. But I could
not entirely pass it over in silence, and regret that my former
refusal must now become doubly annoying to my relations.
I beg your pardon for thus frankly stating my feelings to you

not only that it will be generally approved, but that Sir Charles
Metcalfe's long experience and tried discretion will afford the
best prospect of conducting the affairs of Canada safely and
successfully through the present crisis. As Sir Charles Metcalfe

weeks) to have the honour of being presented to your Majesty

back, the second after the assassin had been seized by
a policeman.</p>

heard the man exclaim after firing the shots: "He or she (the
policeman is uncertain which) shall not disturb my peace of

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and makes no apology for frequently writing to your Majesty
on the painful subject in respect to which your Majesty has
manifested so deep an interest.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel humbly thinks that your Majesty's observations
with respect to the clear distinctions in the cases of
insanity are most just. It will be most unfortunate indeed if
the Law does not attach its severest penalty to a crime so
premeditated and so deliberately and savagely perpetrated,
as that of MacNaghten.</p>

<p class="ind">The Jury are, however, the sole judges on this point, that is
to say, it rests with them exclusively, either to find an absolute
verdict of guilty of murder, or to acquit on the ground of
insanity.</p>

<p class="ind">MacNaghten will be charged with the offence of murder, and
every effort will be made to bring him to condign punishment.</p>

<p class="ind">His counsel will probably endeavour to establish his insanity.</p>

<p class="ind">Nothing can be more collected and intelligent in many respects
than his conduct in prison. He was conversing with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.458" id="pagei.458"></a>[page&nbsp;458]</span>
gaoler, and seemed not disinclined to unburden his mind,
when he suddenly stopped and enquired from the gaoler
whether such conversations as that which he was holding went
beyond the prison walls.</p>

<p class="ind">On being informed that no security could be given that they
would remain secret, he said he should hold his tongue, but
that all would come out by and by.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel takes the liberty of enclosing for your
Majesty's perusal a note which he has just received from Miss
Emily Eden, sister of Lord Auckland, and of Mrs Charles
Drummond.</p>

<p class="ind">If it should be in your Majesty's power to assign apartments
at some future period to Miss Drummond, who lived with her
brother Edward, and was mainly dependent upon him, it
would be a very great comfort to a lady of the most unexceptionable
conduct, and most deeply attached to her poor brother.</p>




<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Viscount Melbourne to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Brocket Hall</span>, <i>25th January 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He has been much gratified this morning by receiving your
Majesty's letter of the 23rd; he has determined upon following
your Majesty's advice, and upon not hazarding the throwing
himself back by coming up to London and attempting to
attend the House of Lords at the commencement of the
Session. The assassination of Mr Drummond, for Lord Melbourne
fears it must be called so, is indeed a dreadful thing.
Lord Melbourne is not surprised, for people are very apt to
turn all their wrath and indignation upon the man from whom
they actually receive an answer which they do not like, without
in the least considering whether he is really responsible for it.
Lord Melbourne used often to be himself assailed with threats
of personal violence. Sometimes he took notice of them by
swearing the peace against those who used them, and having
them bound over in sureties. Sometimes he disregarded them,
but he does not think it either prudent or justifiable entirely
to neglect such intimations. Lord Melbourne does not wonder
that this event brings to your Majesty's recollection what has
taken place in your own case.</p>

<p class="ind">Hallam is, in Lord Melbourne's opinion, right about Ireland.
Her advocates are very loud in their outcry, but she has not
really much to complain of.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne was very glad to hear of the marriage of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.459" id="pagei.459"></a>[page&nbsp;459]</span>
Prince Augustus of Coburg with the Princess Cl&eacute;mentine, as
he apprehends that the connection must be very agreeable to
your Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne begs to be respectfully and affectionately
remembered to His Royal Highness.</p>




<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>Sir James Graham to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">COMMITTAL OF MACNAGHTEN</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Whitehall</span>, <i>28th January 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir James Graham, with humble duty, begs to inform your
Majesty, that the prisoner Daniel MacNaghten was fully committed
for trial this afternoon. He was not defended before
the Magistrates; but in his manner he was quite cool, intelligent,
and collected; he asked no questions, but he expressed
a wish to have copies of the Depositions.</p>

<p class="ind">His trial will probably commence on Friday or Saturday
next, and there is reason to believe that, at the request of his
relatives in Glasgow, counsel will be retained, and that the plea
of insanity will be raised in his defence.<sup>8</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Every preparation is in progress to meet this vague and
dangerous excuse. It will turn out that the pistols were
bought at Paisley by MacNaghten on the 6th of August last;
and information has reached Sir James Graham, which, he
thinks, will prove that MacNaghten is a Chartist, that he has
attended political meetings at Glasgow, and that he has taken
a violent part in politics. He yesterday saw a Presbyterian
clergyman, who prayed with him; who pointed out the
atrocity of his crime, the innocence of his victim, the pangs of
sorrowing relatives, and who exhorted him to contrition and
repentance. Some impression was made at the moment; but
his general demeanour is marked by cold reserve and hardness
of heart.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 8: He was defended by four counsel, including Mr Cockburn, afterwards Lord Chief
Justice.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE ROYAL FAMILY AND POLITICS</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Brocket Hall</span>, <i>2nd February 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and thanks much for the letter of the 30th ult., which he
received here yesterday morning. He believes it is more
prudent not to go to London, but he greatly regrets that his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.460" id="pagei.460"></a>[page&nbsp;460]</span>
not doing so will deprive him for so long a time of the honour
and pleasure of seeing your Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">The Duke of Sussex acquainted Lord Melbourne and took
his opinion before he issued his cards for the dinner. Lord
Melbourne does not think that he can have any idea of playing
the part to which Lord Erroll alluded. It is better that a
dinner should be given somewhere. He having nothing of the
kind would look too much like giving up the whole business and
disbanding the party. Lord Melbourne entirely agrees with
your Majesty as to the political conduct which ought to be
pursued by the members of the Royal Family, but he remembers
no time in which they have been induced to act with
so much prudence and propriety. Your Majesty will see in
Adolphus the very prominent share which the Duke of Cumberland,<sup>9</sup>
the General of Culloden, took in the Party contentions of
those days. He was a strong partisan and in a great measure
the founder of the Whig party. Lord Melbourne has often
heard George IV. converse upon that subject, and he used to
contend that it was quite impossible for a Prince of Wales in
this country to avoid taking an active part in politics and
political contentions. The fact is, that George III. did not
discourage this in his own family sufficiently, and the King of
Hanover always said that his father had encouraged him in
the active part which he took, and which certainly was sufficiently
objectionable.</p>

<p class="ind">The assassination of Drummond is indeed a horrible event.
Lord Melbourne does not see as yet any clear, distinct, and
certain evidence of what were the real motives and object of the
man. But we shall hear upon his trial what it is that he urges.
Your Majesty will, of course, recollect that the Jury acquitted
Oxford, and there then was nothing to do but to acquiesce in
the verdict. If the Jury should take a similar view of this
man's crime, it will be impossible for the Government to do
anything to remedy the evil which Lord Melbourne thinks will
be caused by such a decision. Lord Melbourne knew Mr
Drummond pretty well. He used formerly to be much in
Hertfordshire, both at Hatfield and at Gorhambury, and Lord
Melbourne has often met him at both places, and thought him
with all the rest of the world, a very quiet, gentlemanly, and
agreeable man. Lord Melbourne very well remembers the
murder of Mr Perceval and Bellingham's trial. Lord Melbourne
was then in the House of Commons, but was not present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.461" id="pagei.461"></a>[page&nbsp;461]</span>
at the time the crime was perpetrated. There were differences
of opinion as to the manner in which Sir James Mansfield
conducted the trial. Many thought that he ought to have
given more time, which was asked for on the part of the
prisoner, in order to search for evidence at Liverpool. But
the law which he laid down in his charge is certainly sound,
correct, and reasonable. Lord Melbourne is very glad to think
that your Majesty has not to go to the House of Lords to-day.</p>

received the same title.</p>

like is that about the American treaty.<sup>10</sup> It betrays too great
an anxiety for peace, and too much fear of war.<sup>11</sup></p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Brocket Hall</span>, <i>12th February 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He received here on Friday last, the 10th, your Majesty's letter
of the 8th, which gave him great pleasure, and for which he
gratefully thanks your Majesty. Lord Melbourne is getting
better, and hopes soon to be nearly as well as he was before
this last attack, but he still finds his left hand and arm and
his left leg very much affected, and he does not recover his
appetite, and worse still, he is very sleepless at night, an
evil which he is very little used to, and of which he is very
impatient....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne adheres to all he said about Lord Ashburton
and the Treaty, but he thinks more fire than otherwise
would have taken place was drawn upon Lord Ashburton by
the confident declaration of Stanley that his appointment was
generally approved. The contrary is certainly the case.
There is much of popular objection to him from his American
connection and his supposed strong American interests. Lady
Ashburton, with whom he received a large fortune, is a born
American. But he is supposed to possess much funded
property in that country, and to have almost as strong an
interest in its welfare as in that of Great Britain. With all
this behind, it is a bad thing to say that his appointment was
liable to no suspicion or objection. It seems to Lord Melbourne
that what with Ellenborough with the Gates of Ghuznee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.463" id="pagei.463"></a>[page&nbsp;463]</span>
upon his shoulders,<sup>13</sup> and Ashburton with the American Treaty
round his neck, the Ministry have nearly as heavy a load upon
them as they can stand up under, and Lord Melbourne would
not be surprised if they were to lighten themselves of one or the
other.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and has just recollected that in the letter which he wrote
yesterday, he omitted to advert to a part of your Majesty's
last to which your Majesty may expect some answer. He
means the part relating to the character and situation of a
Prince of Wales in this country. George IV. was so conscious
of having mixed himself most unrestrainedly in politics, and of
having taken a very general part in opposition to his father's
Government and wishes, that he was naturally anxious to
exonerate himself from blame, and to blame it upon the necessity
of his position rather than upon his own restless and
intermeddling disposition. But Lord Melbourne agrees with
your Majesty that his excuse was neither valid nor justifiable,
and Lord Melbourne earnestly hopes that your Majesty and the
Prince may be successful in training and instructing the young
Prince of Wales, and to make him understand correctly his
real position and its duties, and to enable him to withstand the
temptations and seductions with which he will find himself
beset, when he approaches the age of twenty-one. It is true
that Sir John made the observation, which Lord Melbourne
mentioned to your Majesty, and which you now remember
correctly. He made it to Sir James Graham, when he went to
talk to him about the offence which William IV. had taken
at the Duchess of Kent's marine excursion; and at the receiving
of royal salutes. Your Majesty was not very long in the
situation of an acknowledged, admitted, and certain Heir
Apparent, but still long enough to be aware of the use which
those around you were inclined to make of that situation and
of the petitions and applications which it naturally produced
from others, and therefore to have an idea of the difficulties
of it.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne heartily wishes your Majesty every success
in the interesting and important task in which you are engaged

fate of Drummond, thought (or affected to think) that Cobden was singling him out as a
fit object for assassination. For years Cobden resented this language of Peel most deeply.
"Peel's atrocious conduct towards me ought not to be lost sight of," he wrote in February
1846. A <i>rapprochement</i> was effected by Miss Martineau&mdash;see her letter to Peel (Parker,
vol. iii. p. 330)&mdash;and a reference to the matter by Disraeli in the House of Commons led
to satisfactory explanations on both sides.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He received safely your Majesty's letter of the 18th inst.
Lord Melbourne entreats your Majesty that you never will
think for a moment that you can tire him by questions, or
that it can be to him anything but a great pleasure to answer
them. He will be only too happy if any information that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.467" id="pagei.467"></a>[page&nbsp;467]</span>
possesses or can procure can be of the least use or pleasure to
your Majesty. Lord Melbourne conceives that your Majesty
must be surprised at his complaining of sleeplessness. He is
much obliged by the suggestion of the camphor. He mentioned
it to the gentleman who attends him, and he said that it was a
very good thing, and certainly has a soothing and quieting
effect, and that in fact there was some in the draught which
Lord Melbourne now takes at night. But Lord Melbourne
has taken to going down to dinner with those who are in the
house, and sitting up afterwards until near twelve o'clock, and
since he has done this he has slept better. We expect the
Duke and Duchess of Bedford for two nights on Wednesday
next. Lord and Lady Uxbridge and Ella and Constance often
come over in the morning and eat their luncheon here, which
Lord Melbourne takes very kindly of them. George Byng<sup>17</sup>
came the other morning in a waistcoat of Peel's velveteen.
Lord Strafford brought the whole piece off the manufacturer,
and let George Byng have enough for a waistcoat. It is a dull
blue stuff, and the device and inscription not very clear nor
easy to make out.<sup>18</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Adolphus is, as Aberdeen says, too rigidly Tory, but there
are plenty of narratives of the same period, such as Belsham<sup>19</sup>
and others, of whom it may be said with equal truth that they
are too Whig....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne read the <i>Edinburgh</i> on Madame d'Arblay,
which is certainly Macaulay's, but thought it unnecessarily
severe upon Queen Charlotte, and that it did not do her justice,
and also that it rather countenanced too much Miss Burney's
dislike to her situation. It appears to Lord Melbourne that
Miss Burney was well enough contented to live in the Palace
and receive her salary, but that she was surprised and disgusted
as soon as she found that she was expected to give up
some part of her time to conform to some rules, and to perform
some duty. Lord Melbourne is sorry to say that he missed
the article on Children's Books,<sup>20</sup> a subject of much importance,
and in which he is much interested.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne has received the engraving of the Princess,
and is much pleased by it, and returns many thanks. It is

<p class="ind">The law may be perfect, but how is it that whenever a case

seen the trials of Oxford and MacNaghten conducted by the

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;"><i>The Earl of Aberdeen to Queen Victoria.</i></h5>

<span class="rightnote">PRINCESS MARY OF BADEN</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Foreign Office</span>, <i>13th March 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
In obedience to your Majesty's commands he has endeavoured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.470" id="pagei.470"></a>[page&nbsp;470]</span>
to consider the letter of the Grand Duke of Baden with reference
to the position of the Princess Mary<sup>27</sup> in this country.
Lord Aberdeen does not find in the proceedings of the Conference
of Great Powers at Vienna, at Aix la Chapelle, or at
Paris, anything which can materially affect the question.
The great difficulty with respect to the Princess appears to
arise from the fact that in this country the rank and precedence
of every person are regulated and fixed by law.
Should your Majesty be disposed to deviate from the strict
observance of this, although Lord Aberdeen cannot doubt
that it would receive a very general acquiescence, it is still
possible that the Princess might be exposed to occasional
disappointment and mortification....</p>

<p class="ind">There is a consideration, to which Lord Aberdeen would
humbly advert, which may not altogether be unworthy of
your Majesty's notice. Your Majesty does not wish to
encourage alliances of this description; and although there
may be no danger of their frequent occurrence, it cannot be
denied that an additional inducement would exist if Princesses
always retained their own rank in this country.</p>

<p class="ind">On the whole, Lord Aberdeen would humbly submit to your
Majesty that the Princess might be received by your Majesty,
in the first instance, with such distinction as was due to her
birth&mdash;either by a Royal carriage being sent to bring her to
your Majesty's presence, or in any manner which your Majesty
might command&mdash;with the understanding that she should
permanently adopt the title and station of her husband. Your
Majesty's favour and protection, afforded to her in this character
will probably realise all the expectations of the Grand
Duke; and, without acknowledging any positive claim or right,
your Majesty would secure the gratitude of the Princess.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>17th March 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has spoken again to the Prince about the Lev&eacute;es,
who has kindly consented to do what can be of use and convenience
to the Queen. There is one circumstance which
must be considered and settled, and which the Queen omitted
to mention to Sir Robert Peel when she saw him. The chief,
indeed the <i>only</i>, object of having these Lev&eacute;es, is to save the
Queen the <i>extreme fatigue</i> of the <i>Presentations</i> which would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.471" id="pagei.471"></a>[page&nbsp;471]</span>
come in such a <i>mass</i> together when the Queen <i>held them herself</i>;
the Prince naturally holds the <i>Lev&eacute;es for</i> the Queen, and <i>represents
her</i>; could not therefore everybody who was presented
to him be made to understand that this would be tantamount
to a presentation to the Queen herself? There might perhaps
be an objection on the part of people presented to kneel and
kiss the Prince's hand. But this could be obviated by merely
having the people named to the Prince. The inconvenience
would be <i>so great</i> if nobody at all could be presented till late in
the season, that something must be devised to get over this
difficulty.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and begs leave to submit to your Majesty that should your
Majesty determine that the Prince should hold Lev&eacute;es on behalf
of your Majesty, the best course will be to announce the
intention from the Lord Chamberlain's Office in terms to the
following purport:</p>

<p class="ind2" style="margin-top: 3em;">
"His Royal Highness Prince Albert will, by Her Majesty's

Prince at this Lev&eacute;e shall be considered equivalent to presentations
to the Queen.</p>

<p class="ind2">"Addresses to Her Majesty may be presented to Her
Majesty through the Secretary of State, or may be reserved
until Her Majesty can hold a Lev&eacute;e in person."
</p>

<p class="ind" style="margin-top: 3em;">Sir Robert Peel humbly submits to your Majesty that it
would not be advisable to <i>prohibit</i> by notice in the <i>Gazette</i>
subsequent presentations to your Majesty. It will probably
answer every purpose to state that they shall be considered
<i>equivalent</i>, and when your Majesty shall hold a Lev&eacute;e it may
be then notified at the time that second presentations are not
necessary.</p>

<p class="ind">When the Prince shall hold the Lev&eacute;e, it may be made known
at the time, without any formal public notification, that
kneeling and the kissing of hands will not be required.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel hopes that the effect of holding these Lev&eacute;es
may be materially to relieve your Majesty, but it is of course
difficult to speak with certainty. He was under the impression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.472" id="pagei.472"></a>[page&nbsp;472]</span>
that in the reign of Queen Anne, Prince George had occasionally
held Lev&eacute;es on the part of the Queen during the Queen's
indisposition, but on searching the <i>Gazette</i> of the time he cannot
find any record of this.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Sir Robert's letter, and quite approves
of his suggestions concerning the Lev&eacute;es. The Prince
is quite ready to do whatever may be thought right, and the
Queen wishes Sir Robert to act upon the plan he has laid before
her in his letter of yesterday. Perhaps it would be right before
making anything public to consider the question of Drawing-Rooms
likewise, which are of such importance to the trades-people
of London. It would be painful for the Queen to think
that she should be the cause of disappointment and loss to this
class of her subjects, particularly at this moment of commercial
stagnation. The Queen conceives that it would be the
right thing that the same principle laid down for the Lev&eacute;es
should be followed with regard to Drawing-Rooms, the Prince
holding them for her. The Queen is anxious to have soon
Sir Robert's opinion upon this subject. The Queen on looking

Lord Melbourne is very much touched and obliged by your
Majesty's very kind advice, which he will try his utmost to
follow, as he himself believes that his health entirely depends
upon his keeping up his stomach in good order and free from
derangement. He owns that he is very incredulous about the
unwholesomeness of dry champagne, and he does not think
that the united opinion of the whole College of Physicians and
of Surgeons would persuade him upon these points&mdash;he cannot
think that a "Hohenlohe" glass of dry champagne, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>. half a
<i>schoppen</i>,<sup>29</sup> can be prejudicial. Lord and Lady Erroll<sup>30</sup> and Lord
Auckland and Miss Eden are coming in the course of the week,

<span class="rightnote">THE TOAST OF THE PRINCE</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Whitehall</span>, <i>6th April 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel, with his humble duty to your Majesty,
hastens to make a communication to your Majesty, on the subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.476" id="pagei.476"></a>[page&nbsp;476]</span>
of your Majesty's letter of this morning, which he hopes
will remove from your Majesty's mind any unfavourable impression
with regard to the <i>toasts</i> at the theatrical dinner, or to
the conduct of the Duke of Cambridge in reference to them.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel, since he addressed your Majesty, has made
enquiry from Colonel Wood, the member for Brecon, who was
present at the meeting.</p>

<p class="ind">In order to have the real statement of the case, Sir Robert
Peel did not mention the object of the enquiry. The following
were the questions and the answers:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ind2"><i>Q</i>. What were the toasts at the theatrical dinner last night?</p>

<p class="ind2"><span class="sc">Colonel Wood.</span> The first was <i>The Queen and the Prince</i>.
The Duke said he thought he could not give the health of the
Queen in a manner more satisfactory than by coupling with
the name of Her Majesty that of her illustrious Consort.</p>

<p class="ind">Colonel Wood said that his impression was that the Duke
meant to do that which would be most respectful to the Prince,
and that he had in his mind when he united the name of the
Prince with that of your Majesty, the circumstances of the
Prince having recently held the Lev&eacute;e on behalf of your
Majesty.</p>

<p class="ind">It might perhaps have been better had His Royal Highness
adhered to the usual custom, and proposed the health of the
Prince distinctly and separately, but he humbly submits to
your Majesty that the <i>intention</i> of His Royal Highness must
have been to show respect to the Prince.</p>

<p class="ind">The reports of public dinners are frequently incorrect, the
reporters being sometimes placed at a great distance from
the chairman.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Whitehall</span>, <i>12th April 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and will not fail to forward by the first opportunity the letter
to Lord Ellenborough which accompanied your Majesty's note.</p>

<p class="ind">In consequence of his conversation yesterday morning with
Baron Stockmar, Sir Robert Peel begs to mention to your
Majesty that he saw to-day a private letter from Berlin, which
mentioned that the King of Hanover had apparently abandoned
the intention of visiting England this year, but that on the
receipt of some letters from England, which he suspected to be
written for the purpose of discouraging his visit, the King
suddenly changed his intention and wrote a letter to your
Majesty, stating that he had thoughts of such a visit.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.477" id="pagei.477"></a>[page&nbsp;477]</span>

<p class="ind">It was not stated from whence the letters advising the King
to remain on the Continent had proceeded.</p>

<p class="ind">This letter also stated that the King of Hanover proposed
to waive his rank of Sovereign as far as he possibly could on
his arrival in England, and to take his seat in the House of
Lords without taking any part in the proceedings.</p>

<p class="ind">It added that the King could not, in any event, be in England
before the latter end of May or beginning of June, and rather
hinted that as his proposed visit was more out of a spirit of
contradiction and impatience of obstacles being thrown in the
way of it, than from any strong wish on his part to come here,
he might probably change his intention and defer his visit,
particularly if he should find that there was no particular
impediment in the way of it.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and begs leave to acquaint your Majesty that the Duke of
Cambridge having called on Sir Robert Peel this morning, he
took an opportunity of asking His Royal Highness whether he
thought the King of Hanover had made up his mind to visit
England this year.</p>

<p class="ind">The Duke's reply was, as nearly as possible, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ind">"Oh yes, the King will certainly come, but I can tell you
privately he means to have nothing to do with the House of
Lords. He will not make his appearance there. The King has
taken his servants for six weeks&mdash;that is, engaged their attendance
upon him for that time. I know the porter is engaged and
the stable servants. The King has written to Her Majesty.
His real object in coming is to arrange his private papers, which
were left in confusion, and to consult Sir Henry Halford."<sup>31</sup></p>

<p class="ind">This was all that was material that His Royal Highness said.</p>

the people of Hindustan in the restoration of these trophies,
there has not occurred a single instance of apparent mortification

the gates to be a national, not a religious, triumph. At no

a town almost exclusively Mussulman, where there exist the

<span class="rightnote" style="margin-top: 2em;">DEATH OF THE DUKE OF SUSSEX</span>

<h5 style="margin-top: 3em;">
<i>Extract from the Will of his late Royal Highness the Duke of
        Sussex, <br />dated the 11th August 1840<sup>33</sup></i> <br />(<i>sent at the Queen's
        request by Sir Robert Peel to the Duke of Wellington for his
        advice</i>.)</h5>


<p class="ind2">"I desire that on my death my body may be opened, and
should the examination present anything useful or interesting
to science, I empower my executors to make it public. And I
desire to be buried in the public cemetery at Kensal Green in
the Parish of Harrow, in the County of Middlesex, and not at
Windsor."</p>

<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 33: The Duke of Sussex died on 21st April of erysipelas. His first marriage in 1793 to
Lady Augusta Murray, daughter of the fourth Earl of Dunmore, was declared void under
the Royal Marriage Act. Lady Augusta died in 1830; her daughter married Sir Thomas
Wilde, afterwards Lord Truro. The Duke contracted a second marriage with Lady
Cecilia Underwood, daughter of the Earl of Arran and widow of Sir George Buggin: she
was created Duchess of Inverness in 1840, with remainder to her heirs-male.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Strathfieldsaye</span>, <i>21st April 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dear Peel</span>,&mdash;I have just now received your letter of this
day, and I return the enclosure in the box. It appears to me
that the whole case must be considered as hanging together;
that is, the desire to be buried at Kensal Green, that of Freemasons
to pay Masonic Honours,<sup>34</sup> that the body of the Duchess
of Inverness should be interred near to his when she dies.</p>

<p class="ind">Parties still alive have an interest in the attainment of the
two last objects, which are quite incompatible with the interment
of a Prince of the Blood, a Knight of the Garter, in St
George's Chapel at Windsor.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen's Royal Command might overrule the Duke's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.479" id="pagei.479"></a>[page&nbsp;479]</span>
desire to be buried at Kensal Green.<sup>35</sup> Nobody would complain
of or contend against it.</p>

<p class="ind">But there will be no end of the complaints of interference
by authority on the part of Freemasons, and of those who will
take part with the Duchess of Inverness: and it is a curious
fact that there are persons in Society who are interested in
making out that she was really married to the Duke.<sup>36</sup> Against
this we must observe that it will be urged that the omission to
insist that the interment should take place in the Collegiate
Chapel of St George's, Windsor, and thus to set aside the will,
lowers the Royal Family in the opinion of the public, and is
a concession to Radicalism. But it is my opinion that the
reasons will justify that which will be done in conformity with
the will.</p>

<p class="ind">I confess that I don't like to decide upon cases in such haste;
and I cannot consider it necessary that a decision should be
made on the course to be taken in respect to the Duke's funeral,
on the morrow of the day on which he died.</p>

<p class="ind">It would be desirable to know the opinion of the Lord
Chancellor, the Archbishop, and others.</p>

<p class="ind">I can't think of anything likely to occur, which might alter
me: and I'll abide by that which I have above given.</p>

<p class="ind">It will be absolutely necessary to take effective measures for
the preservation of the peace at this funeral at Kensal Green:
and even that the magistrates should superintend the procession
of the Freemasons. Believe me, ever yours most sincerely,</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>13th August 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen sees with great regret, in Sir Robert Gordon's
despatch of 4th August, that Prince Metternich has resumed
his favourite scheme of a marriage between the Queen of Spain
and a son of Don Carlos, and that King Louis Philippe has
almost come to a secret understanding with him upon that
point.<sup>54</sup> The Queen is as much as ever convinced that instead
of tending to pacify Spain <i>this</i> combination cannot fail to call
<i>new</i> principles of discord into action, to excite the hopes of a
lost and vanquished party for revenge and reacquisition of
power, and to carry the civil war into the very interior of the
family. The Queen is anxious (should Lord Aberdeen coincide
in this view of the subject, as she believes he does) that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.488" id="pagei.488"></a>[page&nbsp;488]</span>
should be <i>clearly</i> understood by Sir Robert Gordon, and Prince
Metternich.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 54: Since the Quadruple Alliance (of England, France, Spain, and Portugal) in 1834
to expel Don Carlos and Dom Miguel from the Peninsula, the question of the marriage
of Queen Isabella (then aged four) had been a subject of incessant consideration by
England and France. The Queen-Mother had suggested to Louis Philippe the marriages
of the Queen to the Duc d'Aumale and of the Infanta (her sister) to the Duc de Montpensier:
such a proposal, however gratifying to the French King's ambition, would
naturally not have been favourably viewed in England; but Guizot promoted warmly
the alternative project of a marriage of the Queen to her cousin Don Francisco de Asis,
Duke of Cadiz, son of Don Francisco de Paula, the Infanta being still to marry Montpensier.
It was believed that, if this marriage of the Queen took place, there would be
no issue of it, and Louis Philippe's ambition would be ultimately gratified. To Palmerston's
protest against this scheme (before the Melbourne Ministry fell), Guizot replied,
"<i>La Reine aura des enfants et ne mourra pas</i>." The other possible candidates for the
Queen's hand from the French point of view were Count Montemolin, the son of Don
Carlos, the Count de Trapani, son of Francis I., King of the Two Sicilies, and thus brother
of Queen Christina, and the Duke of Seville, a brother of the Duke of Cadiz. Other
candidates also favoured by the Queen-Mother were (while he was unmarried) Prince
Albert's brother, and his cousin Leopold, brother of the King of Portugal; but the
French King was bent upon a marriage of the Queen with some descendant of Philip V.,
and equally determined to prevent the Infanta's marriage either with Leopold or any
other Prince not a descendant of Philip V. The view of Prince Albert and of Lord Aberdeen
was that it was a matter for the young Queen herself and the Spanish people. See

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Foreign Office</span>, <i>13th August 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen, with his most humble duty, begs to assure
your Majesty that he will not fail to give his best attention to
your Majesty's communication respecting the marriage of the
Queen of Spain.</p>

<p class="ind">In a recent despatch to Sir Robert Gordon, Lord Aberdeen
has repeated the opinion entertained by your Majesty's Government,
that the marriage of the Queen with the son of Don
Carlos, instead of leading to the conciliation and unison of
parties, would be more likely to produce collision and strife,
and to increase the existing animosity between the different
political factions by which Spain is distracted.</p>

<p class="ind">This marriage, however, has always been a favourite project
with Austria and the Northern Courts; and it has also been
apparently supported by the French Government. It cannot
be denied that at first sight there are many considerations by
which it may seem to be recommended; but the weight of
these can only be duly estimated by the authorities and
people of Spain.</p>

<p class="ind">The same may be said respecting the marriage of the Queen
with any other Spanish Prince, a descendant of Philip V.
which, in the opinion of many, would be most agreeable to the
feelings and prejudices of the nation. To this project also it
appears that the French Government have recently assented.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen humbly thinks that the interests of this
country and of all Europe are deeply concerned in the exclusion
of a French Prince from the possibility of receiving the
hand of the Queen; and that it would not be a wise policy to
oppose any marriage by which this should be effected, consistently
with the free choice of the Queen, and the sanction
of the Spanish Government and people. The avowed predilections
of Queen Christina, and her increased means of
influence recently acquired, render this a matter of considerable
anxiety and importance at the present moment.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>9th October 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen has received Lord Aberdeen's two letters. She
has been reflecting upon his proposition that Mr Lytton
Bulwer<sup>70</sup> should be appointed Minister at Madrid, and quite
approves it. The Queen trusts that he will try and keep on
the best terms with the French Minister there, and that without
in any way weakening our interests, the representatives
of these two powerful countries will act <i>together</i>. The Queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.495" id="pagei.495"></a>[page&nbsp;495]</span>
feels <i>certain</i> that if it is known by <i>our</i> respective Ministers that
<i>both</i> Governments <i>wish</i> to act <i>together</i>, and not
<i>against</i> one
another, that much irritation will be avoided; and that our
agents, particularly in distant countries, will understand that
they are <i>not</i> fulfilling the wishes of their Sovereign by representing
every little incident in the most unfavourable light....</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen hopes that Lord Aberdeen will take some early
opportunity of employing Mr Aston. Who will replace Mr
Bulwer at Paris? his successor ought to be an efficient man,
as Lord Cowley<sup>71</sup> is rather infirm. The Queen regrets to say
that the Duc de Bordeaux<sup>72</sup> is coming here; he really must not
be received by the Queen, as she fears his reception at Berlin
has done <i>no</i> good; and altogether, from what she sees in the
papers, she fears there is no good purpose in his coming here.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 71: Lord Cowley, brother of the Duke of Wellington, and one of four brothers all either

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Uncle</span>,&mdash;It is not my day, but my object in
writing is to speak to you about the <i>dear</i> Nemours' visit, which
we are so anxious to see accomplished. Louise writes to me
about the Duke of Bordeaux coming to England making some
difficulty, and I wish therefore to state what we know of the
affair. We <i>understand</i> (for of course we have had no direct
communication) that the Duc de Bordeaux has embarked at
Hamburg for <i>Hull</i>, and intends travelling in Scotland <i>before</i> he
visits England, and <i>that</i> incognito and under the name of
Comte <i>tel et tel</i>; his being in Scotland when Nemours is in
England, and particularly <i>on a visit to us here</i>, <i>could</i> make
<i>no</i> difficulty, and even if he were travelling about <i>incognito</i> in
England, it could not signify, I think. Moreover, I feel certain
that if he knew that <i>I</i> had invited the Nemours and that
they were coming over shortly, he would go away, as the
Legitimists would not be pleased at Nemours being <i>f&ecirc;ted</i> by
me&mdash;<i>while their Henry V</i>. was <i>not</i> even noticed or received. I
could easily, and indeed have almost done so, make it known
generally that <i>I</i> expect the Nemours, and I would say <i>immediately</i>,
and he would be sure to get out of the way. I cannot
tell you <i>how very</i> anxious we are to see the Nemours; I
have been thinking of nothing else, and to lose this great
pleasure would be too mortifying. Moreover, as I really and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.496" id="pagei.496"></a>[page&nbsp;496]</span>
truly do not think it need be, it would be <i>best</i> if the Nemours
could come <i>before</i> the 10th of November; which is the <i>latest</i>
term when they could come? Now pray, dearest Uncle, do
settle this for me; you have no notion <i>how</i> we wish it. I will
be sure to let you know what I hear, and if there is anything
you could suggest about this, I need not say but that we shall
attend to it with pleasure. The Grand Duke Michael will be

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>17th October 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Uncle</span>,&mdash;Your kind letter of the 13th I received
yesterday, and return you my warmest thanks for it....</p>

<p class="ind">By your letter, and by one I received from Victoire yesterday
morning, I see every reason to hope that we shall see the dear
Nemours, for there will be no difficulty to prevent that poor
stupid Duc de Bordeaux from being <i>in London</i> at the time. He
is to be informed indirectly that the Nemours are coming at
the beginning of next month on a visit to us, in consequence of
a pressing invitation of ours; this alone will keep him off, as
the contrast would be disagreeable to the Legitimists. Independent
of this, his disembarkation at Hull, and proceeding
at once to Scotland, seems to indicate his wish to be in
private.</p>

<p class="ind">The great event of the day is O'Connell's arrest;<sup>73</sup> they have
found bail, but the trial will shortly commence. The case
against him is <i>very</i> strong, the lawyers say.</p>

<p class="ind">Everything is perfectly quiet at Dublin. You will have
seen how O'Connell has abused the King; it is all because our
visit to Eu has put an end to <i>any</i> hopes of assistance from
France, which he pretended there would be, and he now declares
for the Duc de Bordeaux!...</p>

<p class="ind">You must encourage the dear King and Queen to send over
some of the dear family often to us; <i>ils seront re&ccedil;us a bras

<span class="rightnote">THE DUC DE BORDEAUX</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Drayton Manor</span>, <i>20th October 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;The enclosed letter<sup>75</sup> from Sir James Graham to me
(which as your Royal Highness will perceive is <i>entirely of a
private character</i>) contains details of a conversation with Baron
Neumann which will, I think, be interesting to Her Majesty
and to your Royal Highness; and knowing your Royal Highness
will consider the communication a confidential one, I
prefer sending the letter <i>in extenso</i> to the making of any extracts
from it.</p>

<p class="ind">I am afraid there is more in the Duc de Bordeaux's visit
than the mere gratification of a desire on his part to see again
places with which he was familiar in his youth.</p>

<p class="ind">If, however, he should be so ill-advised as to make any
political demonstration, or to ally himself with any particular
party in this country, he would, in my opinion, derive little
from it, and there would be the opportunity of giving to the
King of the French a new proof of our fidelity to our engagements,
and of the steadiness of our friendship towards him and
his dynasty.</p>

<p class="ind">The great body of the French people would comprehend the
object of any such demonstrations on the part of the Duc de
Bordeaux, and would, it is to be hoped, see in them an additional
motive for union in support of the King, and confidence
in the honour and integrity of this country.</p>

<p class="ind">I will not fail to inform the Grand Duke of Her Majesty's
intended visit to Cambridge, and to suggest to him that it will
not be convenient to the Queen to receive him at Windsor
before Saturday at the earliest, and probably Monday.</p>

<p class="ind">On the day after I spoke to your Royal Highness I gave
instructions for enquiries to be made respecting the two properties
in the Isle of Wight.<sup>76</sup> It is necessary to make such
enquiries through some very confidential channel, as a suspicion
of the object of them would probably greatly enhance the price.</p>

<p class="ind">The party on whom I could entirely rely was out of town,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.498" id="pagei.498"></a>[page&nbsp;498]</span>
but will return to-morrow, and will immediately find out what
he can respecting the properties.</p>

<p class="ind">The result shall be made known to the Queen and your Royal
Highness without delay.</p>

<p class="ind">Will your Royal Highness have the goodness to mention this
to Her Majesty?...</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE QUEEN'S DECISION</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>21st October 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dear Sir Robert</span>,&mdash;I return you Sir James Graham's
letter. There is a pretty general impression of the Duc de
Bordeaux's visit being a got-up thing for various political
intrigues. I confess I do not understand the link with Ireland,
or at least the importance of his being well received by the
Roman Catholics, but am strongly impressed that his presence
whether in Scotland, England, or Ireland is for no good, and
therefore think it our duty that we should render it difficult
for him to protract it. The Queen and myself think that the
uncertainty of his being received at Court or not is doing harm,
and would <i>much</i> wish, therefore, that it was <i>decidedly</i> stated
<i>that the Queen will not receive him</i>. His coming here without
ever asking (indeed knowing that it was disliked), as well as the
part which Austria and Prussia seem to have taken in the
matter, do not strengthen his claim for such a favour. No
good can come from the reception, and the King of the French
must prefer its not taking place. Let us, therefore, settle that
point, and show that we are neither afraid of him nor prepared
to be made dupes of.</p>

<p class="ind">The Queen is desirous that no official person should treat the
Duke with a distinction which is likely to attract unnecessary
attention. Believe me, always yours truly,</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>24th October 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Uncle</span>,&mdash;I had the happiness of receiving your
most kind letter of the 20th yesterday, for which I thank you
very much. The good news of the dear Nemours coming is a
great happiness to us, and I fervently hope and trust that the
Duc de Bordeaux will be kept off, which I <i>fully</i> expect he will.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.499" id="pagei.499"></a>[page&nbsp;499]</span>
Suppose, however, he could <i>not</i> be, and the Nemours could not
come <i>then</i>, would the King not kindly allow them to come later?
Even if the Chambers were to be sitting&mdash;such a little <i>Ausflug</i>
of ten days only could really not be a great inconvenience?
Surely if you were to mention this to the dear King, with my
affectionate respects, he would grant it. It is besides only in
<i>case</i> Bordeaux should come to London, which I <i>really</i> think he
will <i>not</i>, if he once knows that the Nemours are coming. And
I must add that I think Nemours not coming at <i>all</i> this year,
after it had been announced, would have a bad effect, particularly
as people here think that some great Powers have
instigated Bordeaux's coming here,&mdash;and even think that the
Roman Catholics and Repealers in Ireland mean to make use of
him. Consequently Nemours <i>not</i> coming <i>at all</i>, should he be
prevented from coming at the beginning of November, would
not be a good thing <i>politically</i>, independent of the <i>extreme
disappointment</i>
it would cause us....</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen, with his humble duty, begs to lay before
your Majesty another letter received last night from Lord
Morton,<sup>78</sup> which gives an account of the visit of the Duc de
Bordeaux, and of his further communication with the Duc de
L&eacute;vis on the projects and views of His Royal Highness.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen has ventured to submit this letter to your
Majesty, although not intended for your Majesty's perusal, as
it gives a pleasing and satisfactory description of the conduct
and sentiments of this unfortunate Prince.</p>

<p class="ind">In order to explain to your Majesty how Lord Morton, who
lives in a very retired manner, should have received a visit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.500" id="pagei.500"></a>[page&nbsp;500]</span>
from the Duc de Bordeaux, Lord Aberdeen begs to mention
that when the family of Charles X. resided at Edinburgh, after
the Revolution of July 1830, they received information more
than once, from the present Royal Family of France, that
certain desperate characters had left Paris for Edinburgh, with
the intention of assassinating the Duc de Bordeaux, in order
to prevent all possibility of a Restoration. In consequence of
this information, it was thought to be dangerous for the Prince
to walk or to expose himself in the neighbourhood of Holyrood
House. He was frequently driven in a carriage to Lord Morton's,<sup>79</sup>
where he remained for a few hours, taking exercise in
the park, and playing with Lord Morton's children. It is
the recollection of this which has led the Prince to make his
acknowledgments on the present occasion.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen also begs humbly to mention to your Majesty
that on his arrival here he found the Duke and Duchess of
Buccleuch in expectation of a visit from the Duc de Bordeaux,
on his way from Glasgow to Carlisle. Lord Aberdeen informed
the Duke and Duchess of the objections which might exist to
this visit; but he believes that communications on the subject
had already gone too far to render it possible to break it off with
any degree of propriety. The great attentions paid by the Duke
and his predecessors to the French Royal Family, both during
the former and last emigration, sufficient account for this desire
on the part of the Prince.</p>

dear and perfect family) I think these long absences distress
your faithful Belgians a little.</p>

more enthusiasm than was shown at Cambridge, and in particular
by the Undergraduates. They received my dear Angel,
too, with the greatest enthusiasm. This is useful, as these young
people <i>will all, in time</i>, have a certain part to play; they are
the rising generation, and an event of this kind makes a lasting
impression on their minds.</p>

<p class="ind">You will have heard from Louise that there is no longer any
impediment to the dear Nemours coming, which you may
easily conceive gives me the greatest satisfaction. Since then,
I have heard that Bordeaux does not intend visiting London
till he sees by the papers that the Nemours are gone. I saw a
letter from a gentleman, with whom he had been staying, and
who says that he is very pleasing and unaffected, and very
easily amused, and quite pleased "with missing a few pheasants,
and dancing quadrilles in the evening to a pianoforte."
Poor fellow! his fate certainly is a melancholy one. He should
renounce, buy some property in Germany, and marry, and
settle there.</p>

<p class="ind">I am glad to hear of Montpensier's arrival, and that my

with all he has seen, and I must say is very amiable and civil.
He has got a most charming large dog, called Dragon, like a
Newfoundland, only brown and white, with the most expressive
eyes imaginable and <i>si bien dress&eacute;</i>. Prince Alexander of the
Netherlands is also coming down to take leave this week. We
never had so many visitors.</p>

<p class="ind">I am beyond everything interested with that beautiful novel
by Rellstab,<sup>81</sup> <i>1812</i>, which I know you admire so much. The
description of the Russian Campaign is incomparable, and so
beautifully written. You quite <i>see</i> everything before you.
Have you read his other, <i>Paris und Algier</i>? By the by, have
you read Custine's<sup>82</sup> book on Russia? They say it is very

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Drayton Manor</span>, <i>31st October 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Sir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and begs leave to return to your Majesty the accompanying
communication from Lord Ellenborough, and a letter which
your Majesty proposes to send to Lord Ellenborough.</p>

<p class="ind">In compliance with your Majesty's desire that Sir Robert
Peel should inform your Majesty whether he sees anything
objectionable in that letter, Sir Robert Peel humbly represents
to your Majesty that he does not think it would be advisable
for your Majesty personally to express to the Governor-General
of India your Majesty's opinion with regard either to the policy
of retaining Scinde,<sup>84</sup> as being of the greatest importance to the
security of the Indian Empire, or as to the completeness of the
defence of Sir Charles Napier from the accusations brought
against him.</p>

<p class="ind">He humbly and most respectfully takes the liberty of submitting
to your Majesty, that these being matters of important
public concern, the regular and constitutional channel for conveying
the opinion of your Majesty with respect to them would
be through your Majesty's servants.</p>

<p class="ind">In the particular case, indeed, of India, instructions do not
proceed from your Majesty's servants, directly signifying your
Majesty's pleasure, but are conveyed in despatches to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.503" id="pagei.503"></a>[page&nbsp;503]</span>
Governor-General, signed by the three members of the Secret
Committee of the Court of Directors.</p>

<p class="ind">The Secret Court of Directors&mdash;that is, the whole Court acting
in secret&mdash;have come to a Resolution (in Sir Robert Peel's
opinion very unwisely and precipitately) expressing the gravest
doubt, on their part, as to the policy and justice of the recent
transactions in Scinde.<sup>85</sup></p>

<p class="ind">The Court is aware that your Majesty's servants disapprove
of this proceeding on their part, and that they have declined
to transmit officially to Lord Ellenborough, through the Secret
Committee, the condemnatory Resolution of the Court. One
of the grounds on which they deprecated the Resolution was
the passing of it in the absence of full and complete information
from India, in respect to the policy and to the events which led
to the occupation of Scinde.</p>

<p class="ind">Under these circumstances, as well on the general Constitutional
ground, as with reference to the present state of the
public correspondence in regard to Scinde, and the particular
relation of the Governor-General to the East India Company,
and the Court of Directors, Sir Robert Peel humbly advises
your Majesty to forbear from expressing an opinion, in a
private communication to the Governor-General, with regard
to events in Scinde or to the policy hereafter to be pursued in
respect to that country. Sir Robert Peel begs to add that in
a private letter by the last mail to Lord Ripon, Lord Ellenborough
observes that he is going on very harmoniously with
the Members of Council at Calcutta.</p>


<p class="note1" style="margin-top: 3em;">Footnote 84: Earlier in the year Lord Ellenborough had appointed Sir Charles Napier Governor
of Scinde, and had by Proclamation applied the Slave Trade and Slavery Abolition Acts
to Scinde.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Melbourne</span>, <i>7th November 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty,
and thanks your Majesty much for the letter of the 4th inst.,
which he has received this morning with great satisfaction.
Lord Melbourne hears with great pleasure of the gratification
which your Majesty and the Prince received in your visit to
Cambridge. Lord Melbourne collects from all the accounts
that the proceedings in the Senate House were not only full of
loyalty, enthusiasm, and gratitude, but also perfectly decorous,
respectful, academic, and free from all those political
cries which have recently prevailed so much in the theatre at
Oxford on similar occasions.<sup>86</sup> Lord Melbourne hopes he is
within [the mark]; if he is it forms a remarkable and advantageous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.504" id="pagei.504"></a>[page&nbsp;504]</span>
contrast. Lord Melbourne does not know anywhere
a better account of Cambridge, its foundations, and the
historical recollections of its founders, than is given in Mr.
Gray's ode on the installation of the Duke of Grafton, which
it would not be amiss to read with the large explanatory notes
that are given in the editions of Mason and Mathias.<sup>87</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Melbourne is very partial to Lord Hardwicke, who
always is and has been very civil and good-natured to Lord
Melbourne, and these are qualities to which Lord Melbourne
is not at all indifferent. Wimpole is a curious place. Lord
Melbourne is not exactly aware how the Yorkes got hold of it.<sup>88</sup>
There is much history and more poetry connected with it.
Prior<sup>89</sup> mentions it repeatedly, and always calls the first Lady
Harley, the daughter of the Duke of Newcastle, Belphebe.<sup>90</sup>
If Hardwicke should have a daughter, he should christen her
Belphebe. The Lady Belphebe Yorke would not sound ill....</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 87: Gray, the poet, who had been appointed by the Duke Professor of Modern History,
composed an ode (set to music by Randall) for the latter's installation as Chancellor,
on 1st July 1769.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 88: The cultured but indolent Edward, Lord Harley, afterwards Earl of Oxford (son of
the great minister), sold Wimpole to Lord Chancellor Hardwicke in 1740 to pay off a
debt of &pound;100,000. He had married Lady Henrietta Cavendish Holles, daughter and
heiress of John, Duke of Newcastle, who brought him &pound;500,000, most of which he dissipated.
Their only child, Margaret, the "noble lovely little Peggy" of Prior, married
William Bentinck, second Duke of Portland. Lady Oxford sold to the nation the "Harleian
Collection" of manuscripts, now in the British Museum.</p>

<p class="note1">Footnote 90: Alluding to the rarely printed poem "Colin's Mistakes," where "Bright Ca'ndish
Holles Harley" is seen in the glades of Wimpole by the dreamy youth, and mistaken for
Gloriana, Belphebe, etc.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Whitehall</span>, <i>9th November 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;I was greatly gratified by learning on my return to
London last night from Witley Court that it is not improbable
that Her Majesty and your Royal Highness may confer the
high honour of a visit to Drayton Manor towards the conclusion
of the present month.</p>

<p class="ind">I venture to think, from what I saw of Witley Court, that
the arrangement proposed by your Royal Highness will be
more convenient to Her Majesty than the staying at Witley
Court.</p>

<p class="ind">I can assure your Royal Highness that nothing shall be left
undone by Lady Peel and me to contribute to the comfort of
Her Majesty and your Royal Highness during your occupation
of Drayton Manor, and to mark our sense of the kind condescension
of Her Majesty and your Royal Highness in making it

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;I send to your Royal Highness a little book which is
published every month, giving very useful information as to
distances, or at least times, on all the railways. Possibly your
Royal Highness has this book regularly sent to you.</p>

<p class="ind">I think, before Her Majesty promises a visit to Witley Court,
there are one or two points worthy of consideration which are
in favour of proposing to the Queen Dowager to meet the
Queen at Drayton Manor first. The Queen would have to go
and to return in the same day. The Queen Dowager might
remain either one night or two nights at Drayton. Secondly,
the Birmingham and Derby line is not on the same level with
the line which goes to Droitwich (eleven miles from Witley
Court), and there is a little delay in posting a carriage, or in
passing from the lower line of railway to the upper.</p>

<p class="ind">Thirdly, there is the passage for Her Majesty, though not
through Birmingham as in an ordinary travelling carriage, yet
in the immediate outskirts of the town, and this twice in the
same day.</p>

<p class="ind">The Corporation (which is a completely Radical one) might
solicit permission to present an Address to Her Majesty at the
station.</p>

<p class="ind">There would, I am sure, be nothing but demonstrations of
the greatest loyalty and attachment to Her Majesty, but there
would probably be a great concourse of people, and some delay,
if the Address were received.</p>

<p class="ind">Perhaps your Royal Highness will think of these suggestions,
which I am induced to offer by the desire to foresee everything
which may have a bearing upon the personal comfort of the
Queen.</p>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>14th November 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest, kindest Uncle</span>,&mdash;A long and most <i>interesting</i>
letter reached me on Sunday, dated 9th and 10th, and I beg
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.506" id="pagei.506"></a>[page&nbsp;506]</span>
to return my warmest thanks for it. The confidence you show
me I feel deeply and gratefully, and you may rely on my discretion.
Before I touch upon any of the subjects in your letter
I will give you news of our visitors. The dear Nemours
arrived safely after a good passage on Saturday, well but very
tired. They are now quite recovered, and we are too happy
to have them here. Nemours looks well, and is very kind and
amiable, but I think there is a seriousness since poor Chartres'
death which used not to be formerly, though he always was
<i>reserved</i>, and that, I think, he is <i>not</i> now. Dearest Victoire is
<i>amazingly</i> improved and <i>d&eacute;velopp&eacute;e</i>&mdash;really quite wonderfully
so. We are all so struck by it, by her good sense and by her
conversation; and with that she has kept that innocence and
gentleness which she always had&mdash;and is <i>so lovely</i>, dear sweet
child. I must always look at her, and she, dear child, seems so
pleased to see me again. I find her <i>grown</i>, but grown very
thin, and she has not those bright colours she used to have.
All that you say of Bordeaux is just what Nemours says, and
what Guizot writes, and what <i>I</i> and also Sir Robert Peel
<i>always</i> felt and thought. Aberdeen, with the greatest wish to
do <i>all</i> that is kind and right, <i>really thought</i> that B. was only
come to amuse himself, and had no idea till <i>now</i> that the feeling
in France in <i>all</i> the different parties was so strong. You will
have heard by this time that we have decided <i>not</i> to receive
B. in <i>any way</i> whatever. It is a pleasure to hear how mildly
and sensibly Nemours speaks upon all these subjects, and indeed
every subject....</p>

<p class="ind">I think you did <i>uncommonly right</i> in what you answered
the poor King about the <i>arr&ecirc;t&eacute;</i> in favour of the <i>Prussians</i>, and
I am very glad you <i>have</i> done so. It will have a good effect
here.</p>

<p class="ind">Louise will tell you how we celebrated good Bertie's birthday.
The children are in great favour with the Nemours.</p>

<p class="ind">Pray, dearest Uncle, do not forget to send me the list of
Rellstab's works. We think of making another little tour
after the dear Nemours' departure, to Drayton (Sir Robert
Peel's), Chatsworth, and Belvoir.</p>

so good and excellent, and she is so <i>brav</i>. Ever, your devoted

<p class="ind2">The Mayor has taken a violent part, before his Mayoralty,
against Church Rates, and in reference to the state of Ireland.</p>

<p class="ind2">The Conservative party took no part whatever in the Municipal
Elections, and would not vote.</p>

<p class="ind2">They would, if invited or permitted by the Mayor and Town
Council, cordially co-operate with men of opposite opinions
in any mark of respect to the Prince.</p>

<p class="ind2">No probability of any tumult or of any demonstration but
one of respect personally towards the Prince, if his visit be
clearly and manifestly unconnected with politics.</p>

<p class="ind2">An immense concourse of people must be expected, not only
from Birmingham, but Wolverhampton, Walsall, and all the
neighbouring towns, and previous police arrangements must be
very carefully made.</p>

<p class="ind2">There may be a proposal of a collation and of an Address, to
be received in the Town Hall.</p>

<p class="ind2">Should not the Lord Lieutenant (Lord Warwick) have
notice?</p>

<p class="ind2">Is the Mayor to accompany the Prince in the same carriage?<sup>91</sup></p>

<p class="ind2">The Mayor has no carriage.</p>

<p class="ind2">No communication should be made to any party in Birmingham,
except to the municipal authorities, notwithstanding
their political bias and <i>extreme</i> opinions.</p>

<p class="ind2">The late Mayor, Mr James, though a Radical, would have
summoned the leading men of different parties.</p>

<p class="ind2">Doubts as to whether the present Mayor would, or whether
he would not, place the whole arrangement in the hands of the
party with which he is connected.</p>

parties would not be advisable.</p>

<span class="rightnote">THE DUC DE BORDEAUX</span>

<p class="indright"><span class="sc">Foreign Office</span>, <i>1st December 1843</i>.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen presents his humble duty to your Majesty.
He has not yet received any communication from the Duc de
L&eacute;vis, notwithstanding he had been led to expect it, from a
notice repeatedly conveyed to him to that effect. It seems
probable that in consequence of what the Duc de L&eacute;vis may
have heard, as well as from the course pursued by the friends
of the Duc de Bordeaux, Lord Aberdeen may not now see him
at all. Should this be the case, Lord Aberdeen is rather inclined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagei.508" id="pagei.508"></a>[page&nbsp;508]</span>
to regret it; as although he would formerly have seen
him with some reluctance, he would now be glad to have an
opportunity of expressing his sentiments very plainly respecting
the proceedings of the Prince and his adherents in
this country.</p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen understands from Sir Robert Peel that your
Majesty would like to be informed of any particulars connected
with the Lev&eacute;e lately held by the Duc de Bordeaux.
Lord Aberdeen would willingly communicate these particulars,
but in reality there is very little to be added to the official
accounts contained in the <i>Morning Post</i>, which it is obvious
are inserted by authority. He saw M. de Ste Aulaire this
morning, who was a good deal excited by what has taken
place, and has written very fully to Paris; but he knew
nothing more than he had seen in the newspapers.</p>

<p class="ind">It may perhaps be worth mentioning to your Majesty that
at the presentation of the Address by M. Chateaubriand<sup>92</sup>
on Friday, the cries of "Vive le Roi!" and "Vive Henri V.!"
were so loud as to be distinctly audible in the Square. Lord
Aberdeen understands that this enthusiasm has been the
cause of serious differences amongst many of those who had
come to pay their respects to the Duc de Bordeaux, a large
portion of whom are by no means disposed to recognise him
as King during the life of the Duc d'Angoul&ecirc;me.<sup>93</sup></p>

<p class="ind">Lord Aberdeen cannot learn that any other member of the
Diplomatic Body has been presented to the Duc de Bordeaux,
and does not believe that any such presentation has
taken place. Indeed, there appears to be a general disinclination
that such should be the case; although some
of them feel considerable difficulty in consequence of the
relationship existing between their Sovereigns and the Prince.</p>

the account of our stay at Drayton (which is a very nice
house), and of Albert's brilliant reception at Birmingham.
We arrived at Chatsworth on Friday, and left it at nine this
morning, quite charmed and delighted with everything there.
Splendour and comfort are so admirably combined, and the
Duke does everything so well. I found many improvements
since I was there eleven years ago. The conservatory is out
and out the finest thing imaginable of its kind. It is one mass
of glass, 64 feet high, 300 long, and 134 wide.<sup>95</sup> The grounds,
with all the woods and cascades and fountains, are so beautiful
too. The first evening there was a ball, and the next the
cascades and fountains were illuminated, which had a beautiful
effect. There was a large party there, including many of the
Duke's family, the Bedfords, Buccleuchs, the Duke of Wellington,
the Normanbys, Lord Melbourne (who is much better),
and the Beauvales. We arrived here at half-past two, we
perform our journey so delightfully on the railroad, so quickly
and easily. It puts me in mind of our dear stay in Belgium,
when we stop at the various stations.</p>

for instance, at Birmingham the good his visit has done has
been immense, for Albert spoke to all these manufacturers

and that the feeling of many was for Monarchy instead of the
misrule of mobs, as they had it, and that he wished very much

place. <i>Qu'en dites-vous</i>, is not this flattering?...</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">My dearest Uncle</span>,&mdash;Your kind and dear letter of the
15th, written in your true wit and humour, reached me on
Sunday and gave me great pleasure. We have had also most
wonderfully mild weather, but <i>I</i> think very disagreeable and
unseasonable; it always makes me so bilious. The young

folks are very flourishing and prosperous&mdash;Pussette knowing
all her letters, and even beginning to read a little. When I
mentioned your birthday to her, she said, "I cried when I saw
Uncle Leopold," which <i>was</i> the case, I am sorry to say, the
first time she saw you this year....</p>

<p class="ind">I don't believe that the <i>white</i> flag on the house at Belgrave
Square<sup>97</sup> is true. Lord Melbourne and the Beauvales were
here for three nights; and it was a pleasure to see Lord
Melbourne so much himself again; the first evening he was a
good deal excited and talked and laughed as of old; the two
other evenings he was in the quite silent mood which he often
used to be in formerly, and really <i>quite</i> himself, and there was
hardly any strangeness at all. Lady Beauvale is really a <i>very,
very</i>, charming person, and so attentive and kind to both her
husband and Lord Melbourne. Our little chapel here (which
is extremely pretty) is to be consecrated this morning, and Lady
Douro comes into Waiting for the first time. To-morrow
Mamma gives us a dinner. Poor Lord Lynedoch<sup>98</sup> is, I fear,
dying, and Lord Grey is so bad he cannot last long.<sup>99</sup></p>

</p>

<p>
1. Create a directory (folder) named whatever you like (e.g., Victoria).
(The name of this directory (folder) is not critical, but the inner
folders <i>must</i> be named as listed below, or the links between
volumes will <i>not</i> work).</p>

<p>
2. In that directory (folder) create 3 directories (folders) named</p>
<ul class="none">
     <li>20023</li>
	 <li>24780</li>
	 <li>28649</li>
	 </ul>

<p>
3. Create the following directories (folders):
</p>
<ul class="none">
     <li>In the 20023 directory create a directory named 20023-h</li>
	 <li>In the 24780 directory create a directory named 24780-h</li>
	 <li>In the 28649 directory create a directory named 28649-h</li>
	 </ul>

<p>
4. Download the <i>zipped</i> html version of each volume.
</p>
<ul class="none">
     <li>Download Vol. I from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/20023">http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/20023</a></li>

	 <li>Download Vol. III from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/28649">http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/28649</a></li>
	 </ul>

<p>
5. Unzip the downloaded files and move them into the appropriate directories:
</p>
<ul class="none">
     <li>Move the unzipped 20023-h.htm file and its "images" directory
     into your 20023-h directory.</li>
	 <li>Move the unzipped 24780-h.htm file and its "images" directory
	 into your 24780-h directory.</li>
